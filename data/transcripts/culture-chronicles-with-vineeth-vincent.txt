1659028010.0-1659054386.0
So welcome everyone, to Kulkay. We are a platform that's all about conversations. Anybody and everybody can come here and host their own conversations. We have with us today on Culture Chronicles somebody really special, Vinit Wincent, who was India's first Beatboxer and who has recently turned full time indie musician with a new single called Color. And congratulations on that, Vinit.
1659054418.0-1659063906.0
I had a chance to listen to it and it's a beautiful song. I know you're coming up with a full album as well. Yes, I am. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction.
1659063938.0-1659076938.0
It's a nice introduction. I should take you with me everywhere I go prati to introduce you. Give me introductions everywhere so beautifully. So thank you so much and yeah. So what would you like to talk about?
1659077024.0-1659102354.0
So this is the first track on an album. The album is called Growing Up and then some. I wrote this back in the day when I started writing music, which was 2005, which is when I started learning the guitar. Also, it was right after my 10th boards and I didn't know if I would pass and I just picked up the guitar. A friend close by who used to sing and play.
1659102472.0-1659134350.0
I went to him for about a month, but the first day I learned how to play the first chord is when I started writing my first song, because I finally found a way to sort of express all the thoughts that were running in my head as a young kid. And so I started off back then. I wrote my first song with just two simple chords and I wrote my second song about a couple of weeks after that. And my last song I wrote in 2009, which was Color. And that's the first song I've released right now.
1659134500.0-1659166360.0
And that's actually song number 13, which is why I kind of released it on July 13 as a nice little play. It's a little poetic for me to be able to release song number 13 on the 13 July and so July was also my birthday month, so it meant a lot more for me to actually do that release in July. And yeah, like I said, the name of the album is called Growing Up then some. It's launching in September and yeah, I'm going to fingers crossed everything goes well. It's been a struggle though, so far.
1659166810.0-1659183358.0
I can imagine and I'm sure it will. You done a lot of things since you were very young. You said you started playing after standard ten. So I actually want to go into the beginnings. You go back a long way in music.
1659183444.0-1659206760.0
You started Beatboxing professionally at 18, if I'm not wrong. Right. In fact, the first time I heard of Beatboxing was through you was when I, you know, heard about you and I remember talking to you and that's when I understood that this was an actual form and for the first time somebody was doing it in India. So tell me how Beat boxing happened. How did you start?
1659208490.0-1659231914.0
Okay, so I'll give you the long story and I'll concise it very quickly. You and I met during my earlier days as a Beatboxer. You were with a different media house back then, and then I know you wrote another article when you moved to a different media house once again, about me. And so thank you for all the support, which is why you're one of the first people I called when I made this big switch. I'm too glad I tried to make it as a musician.
1659231962.0-1659265926.0
I tried really hard to make it as a musician between 2005 all the way until, I think, even in 2008, when I just started Beatboxing, I was still very desperately trying to get shows as the guy who sat in the corner, played the guitar. I played in a lot of clubs, coffee houses, pubs, and it was a really difficult life back then because it was very difficult to make ends meet. Equipment is super expensive. Maintenance of equipment is super expensive, like a simple pack of strings. A good pack of strings will cost you about Rs850.
1659265948.0-1659283470.0
And so you need to keep changing those strings every three weeks, every two weeks on a guitar. A guitar will cost you about 20,000, $25,000. And that's a lot of money for a kid, right? And so I had to buy all of these things by myself. I had to figure a way to sustain myself.
1659283540.0-1659306726.0
And I was working in the entertainment space, in the event space, as like a back end showrunner. Someone who used to run go, give the MC his or her water, buy them coffee, get them food, carry their clothes, do this, do that. So I used to do a lot of those things. And back then, Bangalore used to have a lot of these parties that happened. Bangalore was, I think, back then, like.
1659306748.0-1659332554.0
The rock capital of England with music. Yeah, music was huge, but there were a lot of musicians still struggling to make it. I was one of them. And I realized this really nice gentleman named Asif Amit, he gave me my first shot at being an MC as being like, a host and a presenter. I tried my level best to make it as a musician.
1659332602.0-1659351906.0
It didn't happen. So I started opening up other realms in the entertainment space. So I was still being on stage, but I wasn't doing music. So in 2007, I made the switch from being a wannabe musician to being a presenter or a host. And after which, Beatboxing kicked in.
1659351928.0-1659371050.0
So Beatboxing was sort of the music side of me that came into the hosting side of me. There was music on one end of the spectrum, there was MCing at the other end of the spectrum. And somewhere in the middle there was Beatboxing. Beatboxing kicked in. And it was kind of nice to do something related to music.
1659371120.0-1659383178.0
It didn't feel like I was being a musician. And back then, people called it mimicry. They didn't even call it beatboxing. I would call it beatboxing, people called it mimicry. So, yeah, I slowly made the transition.
1659383274.0-1659401810.0
I made more money as an MC, I made even more money as a beatboxer. And I finally stuck to beatboxing. That started off in 2008 and it went all the way. I had a beautiful ride all the way till 2013. 2013 is when I sort of sat back, reconsidered a lot of things.
1659401960.0-1659412870.0
2013 is when I took all my money and invested it into this studio space. Yes, I can see you have you have a fully equipped and a really large studio.
1659415050.0-1659434880.0
Yeah. So I'd like to think I also invested my money that I made for Azure Beatboxer effectively into this space. And funnyly, here I am these many years later, using the space to actually produce my album. So that's been my journey in a nutshell. I can go on and on, but I don't want to.
1659435810.0-1659460774.0
That's quite a journey. But I'm curious to know you were beatboxing at a time where people didn't know. As you said, people were calling it mimicry and none of us had heard of the form. And it was sort of beyond our imagination to think that somebody in India was also doing it, let alone an 18 year old. So when did you first hear beatboxing and did you sort of have to train in it?
1659460812.0-1659479166.0
How did you go about 2017? When I started as a presenter, I would go super early for events. Even this call, I came here much in advance, I sent you a message. I'm very particular. I'm very particular about these things.
1659479188.0-1659501198.0
Like, being on time is extremely important for me. And like every other event, I would say almost every single event in India that starts not on time, horribly late. I used to be there 2 hours in advance while everyone's still checking sound. And I'd be very enthusiastic and I'd like to learn things because it's in the performance space, right? So I'd be very enthusiastic.
1659501294.0-1659531030.0
I'd run up on stage, work with the sound engineer, do a sound check, and I'd make stupid sounds on the mic. And those stupid sounds started becoming a lot more tighter and a lot more refined. So by the end of 2017, I was already em seeing for about I'm just sorry about that. I was MCing for about, I think, seven months. Six, seven months, and I would sort of beatbox in tiny little bits and pieces.
1659531110.0-1659555170.0
I remember being in this particular shopping mall and I would have to say this particular brand, 15% off. That particular brand, 25% off. If you'd like to win a Voucher worth 50% off, make your way to the first floor, meet me. My name is Vinita Vincent, and we'll play a little game and I shall give you your Voucher if you win. And at the end of that, I used to go and I used to do stupid things like that.
1659555240.0-1659568840.0
And a guy walked up to me while I was doing that. There was a DJ I would work with a DJ. And he walked up to me and said, hey man, that's some very good beatboxing, you should make a living out of it. And I went, that's what it's called.
1659570910.0-1659600146.0
I knew it was called beatboxing because of, let's say, my education in the space of music. There was a beatboxer that I came across who didn't sound like a beatboxer beatboxer, but he sounded very close to being an instrument, which is what I thought was very cool. And I saw him at Christ University, he was a senior in degree. He came in from the US and Gabriel is his name. Gabriel was his name.
1659600248.0-1659625626.0
I saw him. There was another gentleman named Mark who was also my senior by, I think about four or five years. They would call it beatboxing, but it's not this idea of what beatboxing is, if you know what I mean. Right. Because the beatboxing that you would hear the new age beat boxes make, they sound like an actual kick, they sound like an actual snare, they'll sound like an actual like a proper drum kit and like a DJ, right?
1659625728.0-1659647758.0
So that was a more new idea of what beatboxing was. I also saw this guy on America's Got Talent who sing and also beatbox at the same time. I'm sort of forgetting his name right now, but yeah, I've brought him up in the past. In fact, I've told him about you in the past. Form oh, what I think blake Lewis this is the awesome thing about these interviews.
1659647774.0-1659658070.0
You can actually do research while you talk. Yes. Lewis beat box. Let's see if this is the guy. Yeah, I think this is the guy.
1659658140.0-1659693962.0
Blake Lewis I think this was him. So I also did come across his work, but on on the television set back in 2007, 2008, I think it was 2008. It didn't sound that good like you just hear on the television side, right? So these were my I wouldn't call them inspirations, but my references, but my own practice with a microphone, with good sound systems was my learning as a beatbox of how to make a kick sound, how to make a snare, because they know how all of these things sounded. So it was a lot of practice.
1659694106.0-1659705300.0
On my ride to college, every day I'd make these sounds in my head, I'd make these sounds while less cycled to college in the morning. And yeah, that's how I came up with my set of what beatboxing is.
1659708310.0-1659718280.0
That's a great story and I know, like I said, I know you were very young when you were doing that and we were all fascinated with the form. We all heard you.
1659722830.0-1659742820.0
I was of the opinion that you were a beatboxer first and then you transitioned to music. I didn't know the story was the other way around. So I want to go further into you're a full time musician now, right? That's what you do. I'm not getting paid to do it.
1659745670.0-1659762022.0
I've put in all my savings as of now. I've taken a couple of loans and I'm financing all of this from scratch. I don't know if it classifies me as a musician. I'm trying to be a musician. I don't want to call myself a musician yet.
1659762076.0-1659782766.0
I'm trying to be a musician. Let's put it like that. Okay, I think that's a good way of putting it. But I want to know, when did you start making this transition all over again and why? And do you still beatbox or you are now fully into producing your own music and you think beatboxing is I.
1659782788.0-1659812310.0
Don'T have time to promote myself as a beatboxer. I don't have time to promote myself as a host or an MC, but I am trying to sort of whenever an inquiry comes up that just falls into place, I go and I do a show as a beatboxer or as a host. But if it requires a lot of time and effort, I can't, because my producer works out of this space. My back end team, I have a team that does my audio visuals and this and that. They are also working out of this place.
1659812460.0-1659844020.0
And it needs me to be hands on and physically present, to be able to make sure everything is exactly the way I want it to sound. So whenever I do get the chance, I do go out. But I'm not focusing on it. I'm trying to make the transition away from the identity of being a host and a beatbox, because I've done this for 14 years now, right? So people think I love being on stage and I love being a beatboxer, but honestly, it was always just a means to an end.
1659844550.0-1659875420.0
I love music, I love expressing myself as an artist and as a musician, and I'm trying to do justice to my existence and my journey as an individual, as a human, to try and make some positive impact in that space using music. But beatboxing just sort of got me from point A to point B. So this is my point. Yeah, that sort of stuck as an identity even now when I look up Winnie Twinsett, the first prompt that comes after his beatboxer, of course, yeah.
1659878610.0-1659897794.0
I also wanted to know, did you train formally in music or in beatboxing? No, no. No formal training at all. No, and none of none of the my performance arts is something I've had a formal training and in fact, back in 2007 and eight there when there was no other beatbox in the country I could talk to. Right.
1659897912.0-1659910742.0
Only in 2009, once I started, I met this other gentleman named Vinit kumar. He goes by Beep Vinit. Beep Kumar? He's part of this this duo called Jordanian. I don't know if you've heard of them.
1659910876.0-1659935310.0
They make these videos on the internet and they're super nice, they're super funny. So he and I started performing together. He started jumping in on a lot of my gigs and we started touring together. But as Beatboxes there were no reference to people, so that was really difficult. Also, we had or could back then we were transitioning from this thing called Hi Fi to orcut I don't know if you remember hi fi.
1659937810.0-1659964840.0
I joined Facebook, I think, only in 2010 when I was far ahead in my MC and Beatboxing journey. So we couldn't find people back then, even across the world on the internet. YouTube had started in 2007, I think, as a video platform, but people only started uploading stuff in 2010 and eleven, if I'm not mistaken. It wasn't something you would like, go to.
1659966990.0-1659985802.0
We didn't have data speeds fast enough to access a YouTube. To play a full video on the internet was what you must have the most mind going internet connection on planet Earth. Welcome. So, yeah, we didn't have any of these references, right? So none of it was formally learnt.
1659985866.0-1660004686.0
There were no spaces for me to go to. There were no places that taught you how to be a presenter. These are things that you had to learn by yourself, you had to train yourself. And even being a musician or learning how to play the guitar, singing, it just came naturally to me. I had a family that sort of sang all the time.
1660004728.0-1660035550.0
We were surrounded by music all the time. So it was relatively easier to learn how to sing and play the guitar because I did have that sort of reference before. So polishing up those skills was something that I had to do personally on your own. Okay. You said you've early on played with bands as a guitarist, but were you ever part of your band formally, or are you is that something that you've explored?
1660036370.0-1660056166.0
I've been with acapella bands, I've played the guitar. I wouldn't say play the guitar in bands, I've just played the guitar. I've played as a solo artist in, let's say, a pub or a club or a coffee shop. And then I would jam with other musicians. So that's primarily what I did.
1660056188.0-1660084602.0
I didn't have a band per se. This will technically be my official first band. I do jam with musicians, but the band that I'm sort of building for the back end for September, where Fingers Cross is going to start doing gigs from September onwards. We do want to travel the country, we do want to go to different parts of India and obviously travel the world. Once again, traveling the world is the final destination.
1660084666.0-1660098446.0
Being a touring artist, a recording artist, is the end goal of all of this. So I do want to sort of end up doing that. But this will be my first step. This is your okay. You don't have a lot of in place in terms of the band.
1660098558.0-1660110550.0
Is there something you can tell us? I do have musicians on the back end. I am talking to a lot of people. In fact, yesterday I had a meeting with a drummer that I've worked with in the past. I've done a few shows with him.
1660110620.0-1660126570.0
We've traveled the country a few times doing corporate gigs and things like that, doing launches of products. I beatbox heat drums. I did have a meeting with him, and as I was talking, he just said, listen, Dibs on drums. Dibs. Yeah, man, obviously.
1660126720.0-1660153358.0
So, yeah, I do have someone there. I do have a bassist who's in place. I do have a sound engineer, which is one of the most important things you need. You need a really good sound engineer because no matter how good your musicians are on stage, if you don't have a sound engineer to put that into the audience in the most effective and powerful way, you are going to have a really bad show. So I have a good sound engineer, I have an amazing guitarist, I have an amazing producer.
1660153534.0-1660185790.0
But what I don't have right now for is the money rich individual. And if you would like to send like 120 lakhs my side, I'll send you my GP number, my phone Pin number, whatever platform you're on, you can be my funder for this particular project. I hope you find your angel investors very soon, and I'm sure you will. You stuck at this. You're somebody who's been at it for the longest time.
1660185860.0-1660216330.0
For as long as I've been writing, I remember you've been doing this Venice. At this point, I also want to move into another direction. I want to talk about indie music as somebody who's been in the scene early on, experimented with the new form and somebody who's come right back to it with your single now and with you putting a band together. So I want to talk about indie music and what the future holds for indie music in India.
1660219630.0-1660237790.0
Also that you've always been championing rights for musicians and all of that in the industry. I know you were talking about payment for musicians and asking people not to do free gigs. That wouldn't come up, but okay. You know, I got into a lot of trouble for that, right? You did.
1660237860.0-1660275034.0
No, I don't know the trouble part. I got banned from a particular venue and I also got banned from a particular radio station. And also I got banned from a couple of other venues because I spoke out about me not getting paid for a good three months. And then it turns out a lot of other musicians also didn't get paid, but none of them wanted to go to the press the way I did. And my name was right there with the particular place that didn't pay me along with but I think it is important for us to talk about these things.
1660275072.0-1660296686.0
When things are going wrong, everyone just sits back and they've just watched the madness. And I can't stand that. My music is about that. My music is about standing up for what you believe is right, standing up for the truth in the world, standing up for facts. And I like to practice what I've preached and I'd like to practice what I've written.
1660296718.0-1660338640.0
And which is why me as a person, I've always tried to sort of do what is right. And it's not easy. Prachi who speak out are the ones that get beaten down the quickest and get beaten down the fastest. And then the people who are in the parameter, like the first radius or the circumference, they are the ones to benefit after that, right? So it would be nice if more people came together and practiced what is right and practiced what is just coming together as creative people and doing cool things and good things.
1660339090.0-1660360760.0
I want more of that. So, yeah, I did get into trouble for that. Sorry to cut you off, but please go on your question. I want to ask you, since you were talking about social media at the time, things were a lot different for music. Also, that was the time when we still had album releases and we still had CDs and stuff like that.
1660361610.0-1660380586.0
Where do you see the future lies for indie music? What is going to change? I want to talk about everything right from the sound to how you think music is going to be released. How do you think music is going to reach people? So firstly, what is going to change in terms of the sound?
1660380688.0-1660396242.0
What is happening right now and how do you think it will change in the future? Okay, so I'm going to call the name of a band they call Venchai Method. I don't know if you've heard of them. Of course, they have a nominal band. I've had the pleasure of working with these guys multiple times.
1660396296.0-1660423190.0
We have done a few festivals in Goa. We've done a few festivals in Bangalore, Chennai, Kerala, across the country. I'm trying to remember if we have done one in Delhi. I might be mistaken, but these guys, beautiful sound, nice soul in terms of their music, beautiful writing. They're going to be playing for the F One, for Formula One in Singapore.
1660423270.0-1660436554.0
I don't know if you've heard of them. I didn't know this part. Yeah, I mean, I've heard of them quite a bit. And I'm a fan. They've been announced as one of the acts, I don't know one of the acts or the ax.
1660436602.0-1660447378.0
And I was so happy when I saw that. I got so emotional. A part of me was tearing up because I'm tearing up even now, thinking about it. I'm very emotional. But anyway.
1660447464.0-1660481914.0
So they are one of those bands that have made me really proud from the beginning and they really deserve to be there. And these are bands that are sort of paving the way for the rest of us. And that's where I want to be. I want to be able to take the sound that is not considered Indian, but it's at the root of our soul, it's at the root of our existence and that's at the root of the existence of a band like when Chimet Toast. And we want to take it out into the world and speak to people and be that drive for people's emotions.
1660481962.0-1660509314.0
Because music is beautiful. Music is at the core of our soul, at least for people like me. And so I'd like to sort of do whatever Venchia Methos is doing at their level. I'd also love to do something like that and open out the path for other musicians to also follow. And it would be amazing to see something as simple as when an artist is going through their journey.
1660509362.0-1660557880.0
It's not a simple one, it's not an easy one, it's not a cheap one. And during the pandemic, the number of stories I've had to come across of musicians not being able to afford rent, musicians not being able to afford electricity, not being able to afford food, a lot of them had to move out and move into like, each other's houses so they could split rent between four people. A lot of them had to move back home because they just had no money. What was the most heartbreaking thing for me is seeing musicians sell off their equipment because they just can't afford it anymore, right? So you see a lot of these struggles and something as simple as a share something as simple as a like a comment on your YouTube video, a subscribe to your YouTube video follow on a particular social media platform.
1660558410.0-1660587470.0
A like on a social media platform, a comment, taking that link, sending it to your family groups when they're talking about absolute rubbish on those family groups. Share something that's actually going to change your life, something that's actually going to make your life a lot more beautiful. Something that talks about the importance of coming together as people. I think these are things we need to understand as humans. And you don't have to be an artist, you don't have to be a musician to understand this.
1660587620.0-1660613240.0
Something as simple as just a subscribe on your channel goes such a long way. And every time I've gotten in touch with someone and said, hey, man, could you please share this? Only if you like it, only if the music speaks to you, if my word speaks to you, if the music video speaks to you, just give it a share. And this person will be like, but dude, I have 100 followers on this platform and I'll say it doesn't matter. Like, that one share.
1660613930.0-1660654582.0
The fact that you are sharing matters and people don't understand how much of power they have. It doesn't matter how many followers you have, the fact that you have a voice and you have a tiny little platform and you've shared means a lot. The fact that I have touched you with my music matters. And so I believe if all of us start appreciating things of beauty like this, rather than the absolute rubbish that's going on on the internet, will musicians and artists begin to believe that they can make a living? Right?
1660654636.0-1660672842.0
Right. So I believe somewhere down the line there is going to be a space, a safe space for musicians to make a living. And it's not yet there yet. A lot of them are still being supported by their parents, by their friends. They are living difficult lives.
1660672976.0-1660697940.0
They shouldn't be living difficult lives, but they are. So this is just around the corner, but we need people to come together to make it happen and people like you are making it happen by making something like this happen. Right. So I think, yeah, coming together is what we need as a people and coming together in kindness is what we need as a people to make that happen. Right.
1660698790.0-1660727814.0
And what about music in terms of I also want to touch upon the pandemic and we know we've all been through a period where there were very few live shows happening and I think. Among the performing, it's still not happening. Yeah. In a lot of cities it has been a problem. In any case, I think the last few years in Bangalore, where you are, have also been really difficult with music when you're stuck in and the space for live music is shrinking by the day.
1660727952.0-1660744500.0
So I also want to understand, does the future of indie music in India mean a lot of live music? Does it mean moving to online mediums or to social media? What does it look like to you?
1660747510.0-1660773786.0
Well, it is moving online. There is a definite pattern and a definite conversation. So I'm in conversations also with a lot of people on the back end in terms of the event space right, and people who are organizers. So doing online events is a definite it's not even a maybe, it's a definite something that's happening. Creating experiences around an online event is also something that's been given a lot of thought.
1660773888.0-1660811640.0
Lots of startups that are working in this space, a lot of established companies that are working in this space, it does not give you the exact same experience, obviously, of being in a live audience. The fact that generally by now I would already be booked for events in October, November and December in a place like Goa, in a place like Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore. The fact that that hasn't happened, and I have just two inquiries, I'm being really honest with you, is a fact that things are. Still not opened up. People are still afraid of investing into the space.
1660812410.0-1660833246.0
Festivals are happening, but at a minuscule scale. They're not happening at the level it generally happens at. There has been a movement away from live musicians to DJs also. And this is something that we've been seeing since, I think, 2008, 910, all the way to now. So there is a pattern, and there is a change.
1660833348.0-1660872854.0
So the fact that there is a requirement for us to start focusing on bringing back a lot of live acts and live bands and musicians is something that needs to be a very definitive conversation at this point in time. But that being said, because, okay, the reason I'm also saying this is because I know far too many musicians who have given up on their journey as musicians and who have taken up corporate jobs, who have started teaching instead of performing. Yes. There was a lot of that happening during the pandemic. Yeah, because it wouldn't make me happy to teach someone how to beatbox.
1660872902.0-1660902580.0
It wouldn't make me happy to tell someone, okay, in order to make this sound, you need to do this. It doesn't make sense because you can learn all of this online. And besides, if I'm spoon feeding you, you're going to sound exactly like me, and you're not going to build your own unique vibe as a beatboxer. And so I refuse to teach during the pandemic. But also, I was privileged enough not to want to teach because I had my savings that I could rely on.
1660903030.0-1660915238.0
And basically, I had a failed music video also that I got into pre production. I had this gentleman named Vishak Nayer who came on board. He directed the latest video, by the way. Color, right? Yes.
1660915404.0-1660934858.0
Before that, we started with one music video. I had a massive budget that I saved throughout my entire career, I've been saving for that particular music video. We started pre production. I spent a couple of lacks on it. The whole thing had to be shut down because Keller closed its borders, and he's from Kerala.
1660934874.0-1660959842.0
Him and his team are from Kerala. And so him and the team had to actually drive back, fly back all the way to Kerala while Kerala closed its borders. And the remaining amount that I had put aside, I just used to keep myself afloat during 2020. And then me, like, an absolute boss, called him and said, bro, I'm out of money, but I'm going to do this. I'm going to take a loan.
1660959906.0-1660968470.0
We're going to shoot another music video, which is a smaller budget, and we're going to make this happen. He's like, yeah, man. Let's do this, man. And we started planning all of it. He came to Bangalore.
1660968550.0-1660979326.0
Reproduction happened. We did the first day of the music video shoot. It was a three day shoot. The first day happened. Someone on set tested positive, had to shut down the whole thing.
1660979428.0-1660996946.0
I again lost a couple of lost. All the money I lost. Yeah, we won't get into that. But the second music video failed. And then for the third time, I called him and said, are you up for doing a third music video at this time?
1660997048.0-1661012440.0
Let's not plan on let's just plan and just make sure it's done. So a smaller team and this and that. But it ended up being like a massive team. Once again, it ended up being a two day shoot, but we just made it happen. And yeah, you have Color there for you.
1661015290.0-1661029580.0
It was third time lucky. That's how color has come. Yes, third time lucky. But there were far too many issues. Even with that, I had to wait approximately six months to have a final product.
1661029950.0-1661041554.0
Obviously, I was running out of funds. I had to self fund this. Once again, I had to do more shows as a beatbox, as a presenter. And again, yes, self fund this. It's a very expensive thing to do to come out with all of this.
1661041592.0-1661069482.0
It's just far too expensive. But the fact that the Internet exists is a good thing. So the fact that you can put things out on the Internet and try and make it as a so called indie artist is a massive positive good things, bad things along the journey. I forgot what your initial question was, but I hope I ended it with an interesting perspective at the end. You did.
1661069616.0-1661098418.0
You seem to be doing that a lot. But I want to also see, since you brought up the Internet and we are on a new social media platform, I think the one question I've always had, especially after the Pandemic, is, are we going to see new revenue models? Are we going to see new ways of monetizing Indian music than the ones that exist already? Good question. We should have a way where you just send this question to me and I have it on the screen in front of me right now.
1661098584.0-1661141566.0
Monetization is a very interesting thing. I've spoken to at least not less than 300 brands in the last 30 days. Nothing less than trying to no, no, even before the release, warming up the conversations, this and that. Only one brand has said yes to a financial commitment, but that is a revenue model in itself. I think brands need to be a little open, look at the possibility of associating with particular creative people, because I have the track record of success.
1661141748.0-1661156458.0
But the fact that I don't have a few million views is something that a brand is not too happy about. Right. But I do have the team that have the track record. I have me that has the track record. But yet brands don't want to associate.
1661156574.0-1661186798.0
That is revenue possibility number one. Revenue possibility number two. And it might get arrested because I'm saying this, but the cryptocurrency space is a very cool space to have a revenue model, a possible revenue model. There are lots of these video platforms that run on cryptocurrencies that are built on the concept of cryptocurrencies, that are a very cool revenue model. Obviously, YouTube and other platforms can be a revenue model.
1661186884.0-1661205234.0
Your platform can be a revenue model. The platform that we're talking about, right? Things are definitely opening up. And I also see so this is something that I definitely need to do in the next one week. I need to sort of announce that I will start a so called crowdfunding page.
1661205272.0-1661227018.0
But instead of you just giving me money for the sake of, hey, let's support him, I will give you a limited edition of the album in a particular X, Y and Z format. So that's something that I want to do. I don't believe in handouts. I believe in creating things of value and getting people to invest in things of value. So that is a revenue model in itself.
1661227184.0-1661251140.0
I also think that doing live gigs is a revenue model in itself, which. Has always been that is the oldest method. Yeah. So you have a lot of these distribution platforms that also help you get your music onto multiple platforms across the world. So, as of now, I think Color is on a minimum 125 platforms across the world.
1661252070.0-1661285920.0
It's on different streaming platforms and they give you a way where you can track your revenue and all of that. See the revenue coming in from multiple platforms? Yes. And I've been having some very cool conversations, so I enjoy the branding side of things, I enjoy the marketing side of things. So I'm having a lot of conversations because I'm my own bro, please share my music video, I'm my own marketing guy, I'm my own branding guy, I'm my own musician, I'm my own writer, I'm my own everything all into one because I can't afford anyone else right now.
1661287410.0-1661325770.0
I've had some very cool I'm not supposed to talk about a few things, obviously, but there are some really cool stuff happening in that space, lots of startups in that space, creating revenue models for artists. Right. You do believe that there will be a lot more new models coming and there is hoping for new forms of distribution and revenue? 100%. There already are multiple forms of revenue making, but people are not into it because of the fear of it, the fear of getting onto these platforms and just not, like I said, it needs to work the other way around.
1661325840.0-1661366920.0
Also, because brands would rather invest into people creating rubbish on the internet and just getting their visibility rather than going to credible sources who are trying to create things of value, but who can't afford to create things of value just because that same brand is investing their money into a different space. So it does exist out there. We're trying to do the groundwork, we're trying to reach out to them to say, hey, invest into us rather than something else and we'll give you the same return, better returns and with better quality. Right, that makes sense. So, I mean, you say that there are revenue models, there's not a lot of musicians who are into it.
1661367310.0-1661411000.0
Are there any musicians or bands that you know of in the indie scene who are sort of paving the way for adopting newer methods and looking for new revenue streams and making money in, for lack of a better word, unconventional ways? Are there any such that you know. The first thing that pops into my head, I think Ritfiz and Nuclear. They're two DJs producers, I believe they launched NFTs to sort of generate revenue and you know, NFDS can be traded, they can be sold resold and the artist gets a certain part of the revenue every time it's resold. Right, so they are the first people that popped into my head.
1661411530.0-1661449460.0
The second thing, I'm not too sure if I'm allowed to say this because it's a conversation with a particular brand band, not brand with a particular band. And they're doing something very cool and yeah, I don't think I'm allowed to talk about it, but that's something that's definitely happening. Brother V, who's from Bangalore, who's a rapper and producer from Bangalore, he's worked with a brand recently and his video, I think, is going to be out really soon. So the brand association with him is also like a very cool way of moving forward as an artist. And this is something that I was telling you about before.
1661450550.0-1661494400.0
So yeah, that's something that obviously I can definitely talk about. That video is going to be dropping really soon and because of someone like a Pradavi and because of the clout he brings to the entire space, he provides jobs for a bunch of other people because I know a lot of I was speaking to a lot of people who were on set with him. I don't want to give away too much because his I don't think his teasers out yet. So the performers that worked with him, the musicians that worked with him on set, all of them got paid and all of them got paid quite well. So that's the positives of being someone who's establishing the industry, not just creating value for yourself, but you're creating revenue generation for other people.
1661497510.0-1661510726.0
It's definitely happening and these are ways that can be done. Right. That's wonderful. And what about listenership? I'm also curious about how we're going to be listening to music in the future.
1661510828.0-1661539200.0
Right now, for instance, most of the music I'm listening to is coming to me through social media, whether it's your release or release by the Relief, by another band. My first exposure to it is through a real, which is when I go to a link and actually listen to it. There's very little live music that I'm going to there are limited number of gigs right now? How are we going to listen to music in the future? Are there going to be new patterns with that?
1661541330.0-1661560920.0
Forgive me for saying this, but I think as a people, we are tending to become a little lazy. We're tending to just get everything that's delivered to us quite literally. Be it our food, be it our entertainment, be it our dating, everything is just delivered. Yeah. We don't go out looking for anything.
1661563370.0-1661574394.0
That bothers me as someone who's I'm from the 80s. When are you where are you from? Are you from the 80s also? Yes, I am about the same age as you. Right.
1661574432.0-1661601326.0
So we're from the 80s. So things were done quite differently back then. And I don't like the direction in which things are heading. And I think we desperately need to change the way we're doing things. So with regard to getting these things, and you seen them on your Instagram and on your reels and your shots and whatnot, I also think it is a way of dumbing down your audience.
1661601518.0-1661655526.0
You keep bombarding them with a certain something until they think that is quality instead of creating things of absolute value and quality and raising the IQ level of the population. What so called artists are trying to do these days to get famous is to just put out very quick created pieces of art and they just barred the audience with it because the audience just can consumption. Yeah, it's super easy consumption. And the audience is happy with it, rather than the artist trying to strive to create something of absolute quality and value to raise the audience right. And it's a pattern I'm noticing that ticked off with this entire social media it's as soon as the social media companies began telling you what you have to listen to.
1661655628.0-1661684160.0
Because if I open and okay, I'm going to take a large, I'm going to slap this particular company if I open an Instagram, and if I open it, after a few weeks, my search feed is just semi naked women dancing. Wow. So as soon they're going by, a. Majority of it is semi naked women dancing in bikinis. There's obviously bikes and cars and all of that.
1661684530.0-1661726300.0
The idea of what a man is of my age all working out, dairy based protein that's just bombarding you. So all the things that are just going to dumb me down further is what is being bombarded to me by Instagram because of the algorithms. And I need to start searching for, let's say, plant based foods, healthy foods, creative artists, creative musicians, things that I really appreciate in order for my feet to slowly start changing. But Instagram will still keep putting seminated women there. They put like this bike or a car there to say, hey, this is still available just in case you want to change your mind.
1661726910.0-1661764200.0
Companies are investing heavily into dumbing down the audience, and that is where we're heading down for an absolute reduction of IQ of the mass population. People are just getting stupider by the day. People can't sit and listen to an entire tune that's talks about changing your life, talks about making life more beautiful. They just want to sit and talk about slapping some woman's backside and all of the other rubbish. I can't stand it.
1661765690.0-1661778122.0
I don't know if I've answered your question. I think I have in my own way. You have in some way. But I'm also curious to know, according to you, what will change that? Will newer platforms change that?
1661778256.0-1661807938.0
Will musicians banding together to create something change that? What is the alternative? As much as your Instagram reels exist, a spotify also exists and there are newer platforms like ours that have come up. So what changes that? A lot of the traction to a Spotify, a lot of the traction to a lot of these other listing platforms are also dictated by what is trending on an Instagram, what is trending on a Facebook, on a YouTube and other social media apps.
1661808034.0-1661836718.0
So I believe, answering your question directly, I believe that change starts with each and every one of us. And I believe I am one of those people trying to bring about that change and trying to bring about the quality back. The quality back into the music industry. Whether people bite into it or not is not something I have control over. But all I can do is just give it my best and give it my 100% and what happens, happens.
1661836804.0-1661850722.0
But I just need to be true to myself. I need to be true to my journey. I need to be true to what are facts rather than what are truths. I don't know if you understand the difference between the two. What is someone's truth may not be a fact.
1661850856.0-1661856600.0
And so I believe the change should start with me and which is why I'm doing this.
1661858730.0-1661901970.0
According to you, what musicians can do is keep producing meaningful music, keep doing what sort of speaks to them in this crowd and eventually that will gain the traction that it deserves. Yeah, that's great. That's pretty much it. So I think we're slowly coming to the end of this conversation and I don't want to sort of keep you here too long, but I want to, as a means of summing up what we've talked about and as sort of your final comment, I want to know what your wish list for indie music in the future is. This is the stuff of dreams.
1661902730.0-1661907320.0
What would you like indie music to look like in terms of sound?
1661911690.0-1661939070.0
How would you want things to work out for indie musicians and platforms in the future? My personal wish list, I'll break this down in bits and pieces. My personal wish list will be bring back live musicians, bring back live music. There can be a recorded element to it. But I believe having a physical person playing a physical instrument.
1661939410.0-1661978778.0
There's something just beautiful about it. There's something just romantic about it. A musical instrument. I would like to see some of that coming back. I would like to see a movement away from mainstream noise that just bombards people with absolute rubbish to something that's aesthetic, something that's beautiful, something that's written in something that's written with soul, something that's written through human emotions and the ups and downs of human life and just making that into a beautiful piece of art.
1661978944.0-1661991200.0
That's another personal wish list of mine. I would also say that. But the thing is, Rachel, it's not just about the musicians, right? It's about who's going to consume the music at the end of the day. Absolutely.
1661992690.0-1662030126.0
If you look at any industry, the industries that are damaging the planet are the ones that are making the most amount of money. The industry that are damaging human minds are making the most amount of money. The industries that are just the most destructive industries to forests, to the most harmful ones, to the animals, the ones that are torturing animals, they're the ones that are making the most amount of money. And we as consumers are consuming all of them. So if we don't make a change in terms of our personal consumptions, we can't expect anything to change in the world.
1662030228.0-1662058040.0
So it starts from what we are looking at on our screens, what we're putting on our plates, what we are wearing in terms of our clothes when we go out, and the kind of places that we hang out at. What do these places stand for? So I think my personal wish list will be to also as us as individuals. Rather than just looking at this as music, we need to change as individuals and that's a desperate need of PR.
1662060890.0-1662092002.0
That's your wish list and that's you being very hopeful for a better future, I think. Just one last thing, Vinnie, if you could tell us where I know you said Color is available to listen on a lot of platforms. Where can people look at more of your work and when can we expect the album to be out? If you can just put that out, that's something that will help people reach your music. So I'll be updating my status here on this app quite often.
1662092136.0-1662118362.0
So that's one definite place I'm going to be putting out the information at. Obviously, there's every single other platform out there. The primary video release of all the songs is going to happen on a YouTube. That is going to be the place where it all ends up at because I believe that you still need that one place where you focus all your energies. And for me, that's going to be YouTube for at least the next two or three videos.
1662118496.0-1662138590.0
But otherwise pretty much every single other platform out there. I'll be updating every piece of information I'm on, pretty much every streaming platform on planet Earth at this point in time. So, thankfully, that's happened quite effectively. The album launches in September. I am very nervous about it.
1662138660.0-1662153918.0
I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm just like a bunch of nerves. I haven't slept too well in the last few weeks. I'm not at peace at this point in time until everything comes out. It's not been an easy journey.
1662154014.0-1662177854.0
Everything has been difficult. Like I said, I've approached at least 300 companies and just one company has come back saying, hey, we'll support you, but in a small way. The small way, unfortunately, is not enough at this point in time. But I'm just going to keep believing in the music, believing in myself. It's an unnecessary, unnatural form of belief in myself, but I think that's what is needed at this point in time.
1662177892.0-1662184110.0
So, yeah, I'm on every single place. Any form of sports is truly appreciated.
1662188530.0-1662210440.0
Yes, we will do that and we will see you updating all your new work on Kulk as well. So if anybody wants to listen to with its work, you can find it on Kool K as well. Thanks so much much, Vinit. This has been wonderful. Thanks for sharing your journey and everything that you think about indie music.
1662210810.0-1662224630.0
It's been wonderful having you and let's hope to see you more on the platform and I hope to invite you again. Thanks so much. Thank you for this lovely conversation. Ciao, everyone. I'll see you all soon.
1662224700.0-1662224898.0
Bye.

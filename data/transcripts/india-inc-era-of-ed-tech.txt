Welcome to Puzzle. Thank you so much. I'm really looking forward to this. I think there's some lag between both of us talking. Probably we'll figure that out.
1654375650.0-1654397080.0
So I see a few people are joining already, and I'd like to get into some introduction. So today we have with us today Mr. Adria Boat. He is the founder and CEO of Robano, a guidance platform that provides career counseling services for students across India. And I think no one better than Artist and himself to tell us a bit more about his company.
1654397770.0-1654421854.0
So I just say you want to start off by telling us a bit more about Bobano and how the journey has been so far for you? The journey has been great. A very nice learning experience. An experience filled with lot of ups and downs already. So I'm really looking forward to what's coming up in the next few days and next few years, because it's just been four and a half years, so already kind of a very fulfilling experience it has been.
1654421892.0-1654440866.0
Entrepreneurship as a career option, I feel is amazing. Teaches you a lot. Started off as a just fresh engineering graduate, so I did my graduation in information technology from IIST Shipper. So a lot of people ask me what the full form of my college is. Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology.
1654440968.0-1654453500.0
So whenever I say I AST people, so they switch their eyes. And then when I say, oh, so that's the expression. That's why these days, myself only tell the full form after graduating from.
1654457550.0-1654470426.0
You properly. Is this better? Perfect. Great. So after graduating, I thought that I should start up full time because in college also, I was participating in multiple business plan competitions.
1654470458.0-1654506570.0
But initially, when I participated in those competitions, my aim really was not to start up for real. My aim was to get good certificates and a little bit of prize money, which I can party with, and I can then use those certificates to get a good job, because then it can be proven that how good an all rounder I am in terms of my engineering graduation. So over time, as I started to do a lot of online courses on education, on entrepreneurship, I started to learn about these things. I started to prepare more seriously for these business plan competitions by reading about the industry, by reading about the real problem. I actually felt that this should be solved.
1654506910.0-1654527326.0
And then I thought that, what better time to do it than right now? Because I'm young. Who knows till how long we live and who knows when what need will be created and what is the urgency of the problem, which looked pretty urgent by my lens. So I thought that, let me start up right now. The risk is that, yes, initially I don't have any money.
1654527428.0-1654538482.0
Initially I don't have any experience. But the upside is that I have a lot of energy. I can put in 1617 hours work days also if needed. I don't have any immediate responsibilities. When I started up, my father was still learning.
1654538616.0-1654559686.0
I have an elder brother and family. So according to my family situation also it was pretty much favorable for me to start. So my family did not have to take up a major downside because of me starting up. So I thought that let me go ahead. I started up with very little money which I ended up spending within three months in Bangalore because my original the city where I live is in Delhi.
1654559798.0-1654598840.0
So I thought that I'll shift to Bangalore because it's a Silicon Valley of India. And I started pronoun with the thought process that I'll make it a career exploration platform. So I'll have different courses on different subjects like entrepreneurship, law, automobile technology. But after spending quite a bit of money in all these courses, I figured out that by the time I am becoming a neutral career exploration platform with let's say 500 courses, it will take me a lot of money and time. So let me start with career counseling, skill development, mentoring things which I can scale very quickly and initially the content which will stay similar for different kinds of students.
1654599290.0-1654615898.0
So I eventually made it a career counseling and skill advancement platform. That is when I started earning. So after the first six months I started earning a bit of money through the customers that I had gotten. And for the first two years I just kept going to different different kinds of schools. So I went to Army Goodwill Schools of Kashmir.
1654615994.0-1654642386.0
I went to government senior secondary schools of Jammu, Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana. I went to Jabahanawde with Yales of Punjab in Uttar Pradesh. I went to Zela Parishad high schools of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. I went to Kasturbaandi Balika with Dales of Haryana Municipal Corporation schools, private schools of Delhi and Bangalore. Government ideas of Haryana colleges both private and government which used to call me for talks or limited guest lectures.
1654642498.0-1654683934.0
So I had a very good exposure of different kinds of educational institution, government aided and private schools, colleges and it is so I got to see the spectrum of education and I could see a lot of real time feedback because I was also working on ground and not just completely working online. So this gave me a lot of exposure. And through this I eventually shaped ProBano into what it is right now, which is a hybrid, you can say hybrid platform online and in person which provides career guidance and skill development to high school, college and IDA students across India. The majority of our market is high school. But we also started catering to different adolescent youth and we help them make the right career choices.
1654683982.0-1654712670.0
We help them build the skills that they need to succeed. And in specific cases we also help them learn more about entrepreneurship so that they can start up their enterprises and generate employment for more career options to be created. Till now, the journey has been amazing. Have served about 30,000 students across 22 states of India, have had a good flavor of different states, and now I'm willing to penetrate deeper into each state, not just the urban areas, but the rural areas as well. Well, that has been like a very ventil journey for you.
1654712820.0-1654750518.0
So initially you used to go to the schools by yourself, and what was the structure that you used to conduct the program? Other than test assessment or counseling discussions, what's the structure that you follow? So, initially my idea was to learn a lot about the ecosystem and to understand from the students what they are liking, what they are not. Because online you get very soft data, you get a lot of data points, but you don't exactly get the expression that the student has with each thing that is being sent to them. So I wanted a lot more real time feedback and working on ground gives you that.
1654750604.0-1654776814.0
So a lot of these processes I intentionally kept manual, but a lot of these processes were also drawn from tech. So, as you said, we used to conduct a psychometric test, but on ground because I wanted to see whether the students are understanding the questions or not. And that also led us to a very new learning, which I'll talk about in a while. So started with conducting a Kalyan 16 personality type theory test, which is just one of the theories in psychology. And the questions that I used to ask the students, they did not use to get that.
1654776932.0-1654793010.0
So then I would translate the questions in Hindi or their language to them. But then I saw that the essence is getting lost. And just to conduct a psychometric test, it's taking a lot of time. Plus, since it had like 64 questions, the students are getting really bored. So that was one problem I faced.
1654793090.0-1654829902.0
We had to alter the content a lot because initially the content was very theory heavy. But over time, I figured out that if the students are not getting any activities to do, even in career counseling, they might grow disinterested after, let's say, half an hour or 45 minutes because the attention span is lowering. Then we used to also give them access to our website where they could watch the videos which are related to the sessions that I am conducting or my teammates are conducting. But initially the adoption wasn't as high because we also figured out content a little later. And plus the mobile penetration in I think rural areas was just starting to increase when I had started in 2017 after the oncoming of geo.
1654830046.0-1654856298.0
So a lot of these things happened through which I learned a lot. Then eventually we created a psychometric test of our own. And very recently, I had gotten a chance to conduct the same psychometric test with Amita Bhattan Sir in Khan Manga Karolu Patty, where he also got his career option as an actor. So I think these ideas came to me because I was on the ground. So in a nutshell, this was the experience and that's how we eventually shaped up this hybrid platform.
1654856384.0-1654877170.0
Now, obviously, a lot of the things are online because after COVID came in, we also started to conduct a lot of these sessions that we used to conduct in school online. So now, since the rural area students have also kind of grown used to the online setup, we can support a much more hybrid program where the participation of online counseling is much more because of which the offering has become much more scalable.
1654879270.0-1654906842.0
Hybrid model is walking for you then. And mode is walking because the psychometric test which you've created by yourself, what does a psychometric test include? If you could tell us a little bit. So there are many types of psychometric tests where basically the idea is that I'll get to know a little more about your personality by asking you some questions, kind of simulating some situations for you. And different kinds of psychometric tests simulate different kinds of situations for you.
1654906896.0-1654931918.0
I'll give you two, three examples. So there's a test called Ryosec Test, which is short for realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising and Conventional. So these are basically traits and the idea is that your personality type will be a good combination of three of these traits. Now, to get to that combination, like what's your combination, what's other tiers combination, I'll ask you certain questions which are activity related. Out of these activities, which ones do you like, which ones do you dislike?
1654931934.0-1654963750.0
Or if I were to give you these four activities, which one would you do first? So kind of to see which activities are you more interested in and which ones are the ones where you are more likely to get attracted. That's one type of test. Then the second type of test, let's say, is this Carlin 15 personality type theory test that I used to conduct in that there was, let's say I would simulate a situation for you and I would see how much do you agree or disagree with it. As an example, do you arrive on time at every occasion where you are invited?
1654963830.0-1654986994.0
So there are like a five scale options. So mostly agree, always agree, mostly disagree, always disagree and unsure. So like that through that, then we would kind of get your personality, which is a mixture of four opposite pairs. So extrovert versus introvert, intuition versus, let's say, sensing, feeling versus thinking. That way judging versus help.
1654987032.0-1655017886.0
You bought the sort of career path that could be viable for them. Yes. So what it helps, according to me, a lot of the career counseling platforms really stick by their personality test and they use that as a very big determiner of the career option that you are going to take up at Robino. We don't do that because we really believe that these personality tests can be used very well as a tool to help you with the cold start problem. Let's, let's say Ayanti was a student in class 11th and she would come up to us and she would ask us that okay, what career should I take up?
1655017908.0-1655031214.0
Now? There are 5000 career options, 10,000 career options that I can tell you about. Which one do you start with and how many hidden trials do you go through? Because there's a limit to which you can go through hidden trials. Maybe you lose patience at some point and then you get demotivated.
1655031262.0-1655057814.0
And the whole track was very different from what it was supposed to be. So if I were to give you a possibility that here are five to ten career options that I recommend to you and there's like a 90% or 80% probability that out of these only you will find a career option that really fits your interests and abilities. So that would reduce the hit and trial time that will give you a solution to the cold start problem. That okay, I can start with one of these six or one of these ten. So that is what we intend from the psychometric test.
1655057852.0-1655083074.0
It's not about me kind of predicting what you're supposed to do in the future. That's an astrologer job. But our job is to basically help you with starting and then to kind of help you also use the psychometric test as a tool and make a good career choice for yourself based on the criteria that then we can educate you with. Sounds like a great test to be a part of our course. You would love to do it and find out.
1655083112.0-1655111260.0
Okay, one question that comes to my mind is these tests. These are family online right now. What are the lease of these tests on your platform at the moment? Do you see more students joining in from tier one cities and rural areas as well? In fact, surprisingly, a majority of our market is from the rural areas and tier two, tier three cities only.
1655111950.0-1655139618.0
Which also kind of makes us think that we should expand more in tier one. So we don't really want to single out as such. But yeah, initially the market that we have started with is from the rural and tier two, tier three market because that is where nobody is looking. A big problem with I think the career counseling industry has been that it's been a luxury offering, whereas actually it should be a right. Which is why the society's mind in India has shaped up in a way that career counseling is not a must have in the perception of people.
1655139784.0-1655154282.0
It's a nice to have and that is where, you know, the bridge has to be made. Now gradually it's shifting from a nice to have to a must have. But it's very gradual. And that is the change we have to push through education based offering. So that is what we are trying to do.
1655154336.0-1655177338.0
And the majority of the public that is missing out on career counseling is from rural and tier two, tier three areas because they don't have access to affordable options and affordable and high quality options. So either it's affordable and not at all good or it's not affordable at all. Maybe I can answer Manisha's question. Thanks Manish, for the question. By the way, what are the major career options that the rural area selects?
1655177434.0-1655197522.0
So, Manish, what I have seen in my personal experience, there are different trends, especially according to the village the student is living in. So let us say from that village. So let's say if I'm going to a village in Rajasthan. Now, Rajasthan Stereotypically has four or five career options which are very highly preferred in my experience. So I have counseled, let's say, a good 5000 students in Rajasthan.
1655197586.0-1655238834.0
I'm just giving an estimate in that I see that career options like is officer or civil services, if I were to group it, civil services, teaching defense forces, defense forces and police forces and medical science. These are four very highly preferred career options in Rajasthan. Now, if I were to go to a certain village and in that particular village there has been some guy who went out and became an IEPs officer and got a lot of respect from the covillagers and the nearby villages, then everyone in that village wants to become an IPS officer. Why not? Because they know what an IPS officer is, just that they have seen the social status attached to becoming an IPS officer from that village, which is what they want.
1655238952.0-1655275630.0
They've seen the person's financial life and the person's family getting access to a better financial life. So mostly it's driven by the financial life and the social status. And the more they see a particular career option getting that around them, the more they get attracted to that career option. So in some other village it might be, let's say, a professor in a college in some other village that might be a senior position in Army Armed Forces of India. So that way the major career options that the rural area selects mostly depends on who is more successful in the village and what is it that the students have more or less heard people discussing.
1655276130.0-1655296134.0
And again, state to state, it keeps changing. So let's say in Jammu and Kashmir, army and Defense forces are very highly preferred because that's what they see around them a lot, right? There are so many army and Air force personnel deployed in that region. Let's say you are in Gujarat, right? So a lot of people would want to do again, it's very serotypical, but it's true.
1655296252.0-1655315502.0
A lot of people would want to pursue business because of why? Because they have seen that happening around them. A lot of people would want to pursue government jobs. Government jobs across India is a very highly preferred career option. To put numbers to it, 65% of Indian youth, according to Csdsk Survey of 2016, wants to pursue a government job.
1655315636.0-1655337762.0
Why? Because of the money attached to it. And the bigger thing is job security. So people in India are really bent towards job security as one of the criteria to select a career option. So that is the input that I can give you that let's say in Gujarat, the stereotypically preferred career options will be the ones that the rural area select, again will be a combination of three to four career options.
1655337816.0-1655358458.0
That's it. And that is where my job as a career counselor or our team's job as a career counselor becomes. To kind of start with a completely new page. So we tell them to kind of ditch all the societal stereotypes and all the parental and fulfilled dreams that they are carrying a baggage off and then start afresh. So let's start with career options in every field.
1655358544.0-1655377518.0
Education, development sector, hospitality and tourism, business administration, everything. Let's explore again, let's make a list of our interests and abilities. Let's figure out what our personality type recommends us as career options. Let's explore those career options and figure out what our passion is by trying it out. So that is what we really support.
1655377604.0-1655387700.0
And hence our career guidance is not just me telling people or my teammates telling people what to do. It's about us helping people figure out what they want to do. And we are supporters in that.
1655391190.0-1655397560.0
Question. Can you hear me now? Yes, Anthony, now I can hear you clearly. Thank God. So I have a follow up question.
1655397930.0-1655416826.0
You were just talking about all the career options that the students get exposed to. How many students do you see opting for unconventional career options that we don't like? UPSC, engineering, medical, these are the more mainstream ones. How many students do you see opting. For the unconventional one as designed?
1655416858.0-1655428830.0
Very few. And I think there's a reason behind that. The reason behind that is statistically, very few people have the possibility of having a career option in unconventional ones. I'll give you an example. Let's say performing arts.
1655428910.0-1655467482.0
So if I want to become a dancer now, there isn't space for all people to become dancers. The reason is that if me and you as people have just 24 hours in a day, that some time of it we spend in sleeping, some time doing our own work. So there's limited attention span that we have for entertainment as a population. Now, if it gets very heavily distributed, like only a group of five people is watching a certain piece of content, and groups of five is watching a certain piece of content, then there's a possibility of a lot of dancers and a lot of singers coming in. But till the time is concentrated let's say millions and billions of people view just one thing on TV or on YouTube.
1655467626.0-1655493986.0
Till then, there is space for very few dancers to come up and earn well as a career option. And same goes for every career option in sports, in creative arts, in performing arts, and in the unconventional career options like, let's say stand up comedy, which is again performing arts. Or let's say radio jockey, which is also kind of entertainment. Or let's say a javelin thrower. Because if five people are participating in a javelin throw competition, one only gets a gold medal.
1655494098.0-1655519760.0
Now, if you make that number, 5 billion, also still one gets a gold medal. So not a lot of people have the ability to earn a lot in this field. But there is no limit on the number of clerks that can come up or the number of even entrepreneurs that can come up. So statistically, that is the reason why. And societally the reason is because people don't have a lot of role models around them who have risen from their situation and done that.
1655520130.0-1655542280.0
Why do people want to become IEPs officers in certain villages? Is because they've seen somebody from their village doing that. And because that guy who actually became an IEPs officer also heard more about it as compared to hearing about a villager becoming a stand up comedian. So that is also the kind of mindset that we are trying to create. Because if we see in engineering India as winning, we have more engineers combined than US and China to put together.
1655542810.0-1655557894.0
But in terms of Olympic medals, where are we? In terms of Nobel prizes, where are we? So pure sciences wise, entertainment wise, sports wise, I think a lot of sectors we can improve a lot. And these are the sectors. India has a lot of talent.
1655557942.0-1655589458.0
50% of India is currently under the age of 25. There's no way that India does not have talent to excel in every field. It's just that we have not been exposed enough as a young country to these career options. And we are not being exposed enough to our own interests and abilities in school because everybody is being given same time, same pace, curriculum, and we are having to adapt to that, like factory products. And the more that keeps on happening, conventional career options will be very highly preferred, which is what we are trying to change.
1655589624.0-1655626558.0
So the more we get a chance to interact with these students and that's what we are really pushing for through our sales and marketing, through our business development, so that we can reach out to more kids, we can propagate this message. And the more this message gets propagated in the next 1020 years, I'm pretty sure you'll see a lot of students from India becoming the best in their respective sector in the world. So you'll see the seeds being sown right now of the best professionals in India from every sector. That sounds wonderful. So I mean, as a platform, does Provano provide exposure to these students to different conventional careers as well?
1655626644.0-1655648406.0
If someone wants to be a stand up comic, like you said, someone finds that interesting, they probably won't have the idea that I want to be that finds that interesting. Would you connect them to, say, a stand up comedian for a conversation? Or would you expose them to what is the business side of comedy like in India right now? We do that. In fact, the lovely thing that we do is there are two aspects to it.
1655648428.0-1655672058.0
So one is the mentor connection. So after career counseling, we have this process called mentoring where we actually connect the student to a successful professional in the field that he or she is aspiring to be in. Example, if I want to be an etc entrepreneur, somebody can be connected to me because I'm an etiquette entrepreneur. If somebody wants to be a journalist or let's say a podcast host, can be connected to you. If somebody wants to become a stand up comedian, can be connected to an actual stand up comedian.
1655672154.0-1655704662.0
Because as career counselors, we have very surface level knowledge of each and every career options because there are so many to explore, right? But the stand up comedian knows a lot more about his or her industry. And that is where I think this conversation really benefits that if they have joined this particular field based on some myth or on some factor that they think really appears cool. But then the hard work and the perseverance that it takes is beneath the surface and they get to see that after the conversation with the mentor. So if it is based on just myths, then they detract.
1655704726.0-1655749206.0
But if it is based on genuine interest and ability, then they go ahead and actually pursue that. So one aspect is the mentoring and the second aspect is the fact that we also give them industry trends in these career options as well. So it's not just that we are preferring certain career options because we can get admissions and universities through that. That's why our preference is initially to really help the student create their career plan based on really what they are passionate about. And when a lot of my clients ask me to conduct an aptitude test, I always conduct it with a very big disclaimer that the aptitude tests can never test a student's ability in music because it's a written examination or a student's ability in a certain sport that can only be tested if a student plays it.
1655749228.0-1655768154.0
So we also have to trust the student and his or her parents gut instinct that also has to be included. So it's this kind of a holistic career counseling that India reads right now. It absolutely makes sense. And you can take a question from Ellis right now. A lot of people I know don't offer courses that are unconventional.
1655768202.0-1655802486.0
I have a friend who's into minds about doing sports management because his course does not allow him to be eligible for a loan. So there is definitely a problem of loan eligibility when we go on a conventional courses, even certain designing courses. Also they wouldn't be confident taking a loan compared to taking a loan for an MBA or a software engineering. So what do you think should be the solution here? One solution is obviously the creation of more markets.
1655802518.0-1655841042.0
I personally believe whenever a particular sector isn't getting its due recognition, it has to be snatched. And I use my words very carefully because if, let's say, sports management, it won't suddenly become one of the top industries in India or one of the competing industries, as compared to, let's say, computer engineering as a career option or even civil services as a career option. Just to put numbers in perspective, 14 to 20 lakh people attempt the engineering entrance exams every year in India. 14 to 20 lakh students attempt the medical science entrance exams every year. For law, and which is a very conventional career option.
1655841096.0-1655851382.0
Again, for law, it's not even one lakh. For hotel management and hospitality, it's not even one lakh. For design, it's not even one lakh. So is it that people don't want to do design? People don't want to do law.
1655851516.0-1655883758.0
Right now the case is that they hear so much about engineers and doctors and civil servants that they also want to become that. So for law to become an equally preferred sector, or let's say something even more unconventional like sports management, to become an equally preferred sector, there have to be certain role models in sports management who have to initially, in this societal construct, take the risk to become that. Now, the people who actually become that, since they have taken much higher risk, they'll get a much higher reward. They'll be the drivers of the industry. So they'll get paid the highest, which is in any industry, a very good income to be earning.
1655883854.0-1655910134.0
So the highest in any industry does not ever have difficulties in surviving. It's always the average people in certain industries which are not at the top. So for sports management, if your friend Elvis is in two minds, I would really support him or her. Because if he or she is really passionate about it, they should pursue it. And if they are pursuing it with passion, they will ultimately create a career option in it, even if it does not exist.
1655910182.0-1655931054.0
Today we are living in such times that you can do that. And once you do that, if it is fulfilling a need, he or she will definitely end up earning a lot. The risk is higher, obviously because of that, if they end up doing well, they learn a higher reward. If they don't end up doing well, they can always go back to a second option and pursue a job in an. Industry which is easier to get a job in if you are average.
1655931182.0-1655968080.0
So that would be my suggestion. In terms of the sectors, I think we have to initially put in a lot of effort in sectors that are not supported much and publicize them a lot to make them, you know, one of the top sectors of India like entrepreneurship. You know, ten years ago, I don't think it was even in talks. But today, you see there's a whole startup wave and every fifth guy you know is a startup guy because there are so many people who started up, there are so many people who got inspired with that. And every year, the number of startups in India is now doubling Tripling because of also the news coverage that it is getting and the financial rewards that people are getting for the initial risk that they had taken.

A very important factor when at least Indian students are deciding what to do is what the parents are saying. At least your obligation to listen to your parents and your parents are also constantly telling you what they think is a more profitable and more secure line that way. But most of the time the child ends up going that way even though they don't want to. There's a lot of parental pressure. So I mean, as a platform, do you think there is a role for career guidance platforms to play here to help the parents understand how important it is for the child to have a career path that they would be interested in in a longer term?
1656008830.0-1656051880.0
I think this is a very good question because frankly speaking, this is a piece that all of the career guidance platforms are still to figure out. If somebody says that we have figured it out, probably they are lying. In fact, not even probably, I'm sure that they are lying because with parents the thing is that they have their own sensibilities. Now, what I have discovered is that with parents and students the goal is the same for the child to do well financially, for the child to have a well settled life mentally as well, like to be positive throughout the day and for a child to enjoy what he or she is doing. Now, according to the parent, the enjoyment initially takes a backseat because the thing that if the child is not earning well then they won't enjoy as much, which is in a way true as well.
1656052330.0-1656094198.0
So they are driven to make sure that they choose a career option because of their, in a way parental love. They don't want their child to fail, which is also a little illogical, but that's their love steps in that they don't want their child to fail as much as they did but in the process they don't realize that every person will fail as much as they did because every person has their own struggles. It's not exclusive to anyone and in that attempt they start to think about career options which are statistically more like output giving. So they start to think about career options where the average income is high. Now where will they perceive that the average income is high in a way that's right also where they'll hear more about that career option where they see people around them earning well.
1656094284.0-1656136386.0
So that is where engineering, doctor, civil services all this comes in. And there's a job security as well that people have generation are more interested. In than but they don't realize that if their child is not at all interested in one of these conventional career options where they have probably forced their child to take up. Their child will end up becoming a below average person in that field and will always struggle instead of that if their child ends up being above average or a really good career professional in a field that's even unconventional, whereas average income is a little less. Still, they'll end up earning much more than the previous case, where they were below average in a statistically better career option.
1656136408.0-1656161366.0
So as to say so that is the difference that they initially don't realize and that is where I think these career guidance platforms can really step in to talk with parents to understand their concerns. It's not about ruling out whatever they are saying. Sometimes they are much more sensible than all of us put together so to understand what they really want for their child the goal is the same. It's just that the path that we perceive as a career counselor versus as a student versus as a parent is different. Now if we give them strong logic.
1656161398.0-1656213178.0
So as career counselors, our job is to indulge into research and to give them really good options as to why their child, based on his or her personality, based on the industry trends, should take up this particular career or should consider between these careers and not take up a certain career which he or she is not interested in. If you are able to help the parent and the student come on the same page that is where our role will really come in which is not very easy. I have been a part of cases where we have suggested a certain career option to a student and a parent and the parent has ultimately decided no, we'll go with a much more conventional career option. So that is still a piece that we are trying to figure out. But my understanding till now and it can change going forward is that maybe it will take a lot of good human intervention with the parent and with the student to make them come on the same page.
1656213264.0-1656242290.0
Just tech will not enable it. It has to be tech enabled in person, good interaction. So it has almost to be like let's say how Uber gets me good cab drivers or ULA gets me good cab drivers. Similarly a platform like Probono has to get me really good career counselors who can make this possible, who can bring the student and the parent at the same pace so that lesser fights in the future at home regarding career. So the key really lies in having that human connection with the parents while teaching ideas for their child's career.
1656242890.0-1656274794.0
One question that comes to my mind here is that do you feel like there is a need to have these awareness campaigns or educational campaigns for these parents in rural areas? That these are the options available? Mostly the problem is that there are access to the profession like that professional in their area, or they don't see that, or they don't know what the profession entails. Exactly what does the graphic designer entails? So do you feel like there's a need for these campaigns in rural areas?
1656274842.0-1656288898.0
Basically to educate the parents mostly that your child can also pursue something like this? There is a business there. Very much so. Very much so. Most of these rural area students are first generation learners, which means that their parents have not even gone to school.
1656289064.0-1656321018.0
Now, the lovely thing about career counseling and I would also include financial literacy, whoever is running a financial literacy startup also kudos to them is that career counseling and financial literacy are the only two aspects of education and maybe mental health also. Mental health also, which the parents can also understand with the students. So if I explain integration to a parent, the parent will quickly get up and walk off because they don't understand what I'm talking about. But if I am talking about career counseling, that's something that they understand. So it also starts discussions about education in general at home and about the students career at home, which is lovely.
1656321114.0-1656325840.0
Education should be discussed much more at how houses that's how literacy rates are.
1656328230.0-1656347000.0
Degree completion rates will increase. On the career side, it will definitely help because the parents mostly, since they are not educated, are not even aware of the most basic of career options. I'll tell you a small story to go with it. Once I went to this village called Lady Vidgar and Rajasthan, very close to Joypur. It's like one or 2 hours away from that.
1656347450.0-1656362090.0
I provided a very simple session, like a one, one and a half hour session. And it was just a single session. So it was not even a very long program at that time. Obviously the pricing of a long program is higher. Sometimes NGOs and CSR initiatives don't want to spend so much or don't have that much money to spend on career counseling.
1656362210.0-1656399446.0
So, long story short, I had one session in one and a half hours. I did basic self exploration, career exploration and career planning with the students. In career exploration, since I had such limited time, I did not cover the hipster career options like, let's say, RJ or Dolphin Trainer or stand up comedian I just made sure that I covered the basic career options, but gave them a range of sectors. So I covered education, I covered development sector, I covered defense, paramilitary forces, hospitality, design, finance, et cetera, et cetera. Now, after the session, there's this one kid who comes up from the back bench with three, four more kids, like a group, and he tells me it's a great session, we really loved it.
1656399468.0-1656424718.0
In Hindi, I asked him that, okay, just to see that if he's just wanting to make me happy because I put in so much effort or he really wants to, he has really learned something. So he told me when I asked him that, what did you learn from this? He told me that, sir, we were thinking of becoming stone cutters. So in nearby factories, they cut these stones to make tiles out of it. And that's a daily weight labor job.
1656424884.0-1656448582.0
So we were thinking of doing that because our fathers also do that. But then when you told us about all this lawyer and engineer and teacher so we decided while discussing amongst ourselves that we'll do anything but stone cutting. Now we'll do something amongst these things that Sarah is telling us. So just one session could generate that much awareness. Now, just to kind of follow up with this case, I kind of stayed in touch with that student.
1656448636.0-1656487570.0
He ultimately ended up becoming a teacher, so ended up completing this BSTC training, which is the standard teacher certification training in Rajasthan. So this is the level of awareness that is missing in the villages, not just with the parents, but with the students as well. The students have an advantage that they come to go to school. They get to go to school, sorry, with the parents, we have to put in an effort to firstly make sure that they spare time for this. And secondly, we have to be really good career counselors to be able to convey to them, because they have limited education, to be able to convey to them the fact that there are so many careers and what each one of them entails so that they encourage their children to explore.
1656488710.0-1656525442.0
This is a particular problem that I've seen in my experience as well. Previously, I've been associated with Teach for India as well. So most of the students that each one I work with is under subcommunities. And this is the thing that I've seen among them, because most of them are children of migrant workers or mostly blue collar workers, that they don't understand the practicality that there is in pursuing, say, a professional degree. Most of them would want to just gain some livelihood skills, earn the professional, their parents, or somehow get some money to open a shop.
1656525496.0-1656561446.0
And that's where still the aspiration goes, understandably so, because they don't have access and exposure to the profession. So I think platforms like these could really help these children who live in urban areas, but they don't have access to that sort of lifestyle and awareness that other kids living in urban areas do. Yes, absolutely. And many of us sometimes what also happens is initially it's very difficult to motivate the B to B clients to help the students dream big. So because they want numbers right at the end of the day, there are certain standard sets.
1656561478.0-1656587140.0
So let's say I'm doing a career counseling program with 300 400 students and over time I have also made sure that we are doing longer programs with students. Obviously, initially when we came in, the trust was a little lesser, as it usually is when a new startup comes in. Now the trust is a lot more. So we get let's say 816 and even 24 30 sessions with a student. So now we can make a lot more change, positive change to the mindset of a student and a parent.
1656587690.0-1656617662.0
With this opportunity, sometimes we help students imagine the wider horizons, as you were saying, the professional careers, the white collar careers. And sometimes just because the BWB clients want to achieve numbers, they would tell us that why don't you tell them about polytechniques and diploma, which we tell them about by the way. It's just that we start with the white collar careers. So because they think that if we tell them about white collar careers, the students will start to dream of that since they are incapable of achieving those dreams, they'll end up nowhere. My thesis is very different.
1656617716.0-1656645222.0
My thesis is that if we tease them to dream big, then eventually they'll all start to go towards careers which earn much more for them and as a result they'll be able to pursue career options which not only make their future bright, but their parents future bright as well. And their upcoming kids future bright as well. And that's how we'll progress towards a much more economically well of India. It will indirectly contribute to our economy. So this is the bigger picture that I see.
1656645356.0-1656685860.0
And in this I would say that helping the students dream big is very important, which is a big case we support. So it's not like we are not telling them about ideas, not telling them about polytechnics, not telling them about the diplomas, but we'll start with the bigger career options. That's your plan. In case you're not able to do that much, then obviously you can pursue the shortterm courses as well to make a living for now, still dream big later. Yeah, I mean, that is, I think, one of the most important things to keep in mind while you career counseling because it's not just like he said, not just the development of the student, but the whole community that he comes from, especially under the communities like these.
1656687270.0-1656715398.0
I think Manish has a question that we were just talking about a while back, parents and students being on different page. Do you have any cases like this, you have to remember any stories where you saw this happening firsthand. Students and parents are on different pages and you sort of help them bridge that gap. I'll tell you one very interesting story where there was a little bit of push from our end also, which we usually avoid doing, but there was a reason behind that push. And then kind of the story starts from Manisha's context.
1656715574.0-1656724962.0
So thanks so much Manish, for asking this question. I think the people who are watching will like the story. So starts with the context of Haryana. This is government Idi. Students.
1656725016.0-1656751766.0
We are training them to become entrepreneurs, majorly girls, because of a lot of nontechnical branches we picked up like computer operation and personal assistant, dressmaking, sewing and cosmetology. All these streams are mostly girls preferred in India. So we start training them online. Firstly, we start training them on how to create an MVP, a minimum viable product. And these are all rural area students, so we are not always using terms like MVP.
1656751798.0-1656783700.0
We are simplifying it down in Hindi for them. One of these girls, her brother wants to stop her from becoming an entrepreneur and wants her to take up a government job which is much more secure. I agree with him in a way. But then one day when there's an assignment from our side that we want to talk to parents or your guardians or family, so the elder brother tells me that sir, this is not something that we would want our sister to take up. I can do the business and everything, but let her take a government job.
1656784070.0-1656808954.0
Now, why do we want to create entrepreneurs in Haryana from itis because the employability of Haryanaitis and all over India, itis in terms of how much ready they are to take up a job is 29%. That's how low the employability is. And even the employment that's available is very less. So it can't accommodate all the students passing out from itis every year. So employment has to be created, there's no other option.
1656808992.0-1656842694.0
So that's why we're pushing for entrepreneurship as a case at least let's help the students become more entrepreneurial. Now where does this connect to moneyshare question? So we ultimately kind of motivated that girl who was a little shy initially to start her own boutique. But we did not ask her to purchase land or something. We just asked her to use her sewing skills, which she had, and sew clothes at home and then create a YouTube video of the same where she is describing as a fashion design consultant of sorts or a fashion blogger of sorts, that this is where you can bear it and these are the combinations you can use it with.
1656842812.0-1656877146.0
She made a very basic video using her mobile phone only using like a screen recorder and kind of swiping photos from left to right, created a four minute, five minute video uprooted it on YouTube got 100 subscribers within two to three days and within a week 200 subscribers. Now that's not a big number at all but if you see it from the context that all those 100 200 people were from her contacts because she had uploaded that video on her WhatsApp status. So that's where people got to see the video. She started receiving a few orders, something which even I had not expected, just one video. I did not expect that we'll start getting her orders.
1656877178.0-1656892466.0
But sometimes coincidences happen like that if you have positive intent. Started getting some orders. Now she needed her elder brother's help to sew the clothes. Her elder brother apparently was better at that skill. She started doing that, the elder brother again resisted.
1656892498.0-1656939170.0
So I asked the younger sister, whom we were actually teaching to help her brother understand how beneficial a female face is for the boutique. People will obviously trust boutiques with a female face much more as compared to a male face because a female is supposed to understand female needs much better. So that's how I said it. So then kind of there was a tolerance that came up that okay, we will not accept it but we'll happily tolerate whatever is going on eventually. What happened is one of these orders came from a lady in their area who knew somebody at a BlackBerry shop, the BlackBerry which makes soup and she asked the girl whom we were coaching that she first asked that who is sewing these clothes?
1656939750.0-1656972110.0
She told that Majorly, my elder brother and a little bit of me. Then the person asked that does your elder brother have a job right now? So she was like no, he lost his job because of COVID I'm not making this up genuinely than that guy got a job at a BlackBerry store. Not only that guy, but the Cherbhai also got a job at the same BlackBerry store then in a video, and I have that video still in a video that she sent to me. Her elder brother is just thanking me that initially I did not trust what you were doing but it really helped not only her but our whole family.
1656972260.0-1656996310.0
That girl when we ended the program, a girl who had started her entrepreneurial enterprise with us within a year was earning sometimes 10,000 to 30,000 a month which is good income for a ruler household to function. So yeah, everything got sorted. So there have been cases like this and then there have been also very few cases where we haven't been able to convince the parents. So that's what we are trying to figure out now, how to convince all the parents.
1656998730.0-1657033730.0
That's a wonderful news for the brothers as well. Opportunity to use their skills this way. Otherwise I don't think they would have opted for a professional like this almost towards the end of our time. And I'll just get to one last question from my side is platforms like say Prabhano is a very scaled platform only for career counseling and guidance and mentorships. But there are other bigger etech players as well who provide career counseling services.
1657033880.0-1657071422.0
Sometimes even I see ads for free services and their main business is obviously coaching and mostly coaching. So how do you see platforms, career counseling, platform staring in an industry where bigger Et tech players are providing the services for free sometimes or for a very nominal fee because they can afford. I think, a lot of education has to be spread about what career counseling really means. Because a lot of these at Tech platforms which are doing well, but at the same time they are spoiling the understanding of the term career counseling. So what they would do is they would say free career counseling session with us.
1657071476.0-1657091622.0
So that would kind of make career counseling free. But what is happening in that career counseling is that they're selling their own things. So it's almost like they're trying to book a demo call. Not almost like it's actually like they're trying to book a demo call and they're calling it career counseling which is utterly misleading and that education needs to be spread. That it's not career counseling, it's a sales call that you're being a part of.
1657091756.0-1657121454.0
Secondly, I think these a tech platforms which are doing really well in India is also a very good indicator of what our society prefers. Most of these platforms which are doing well are, as you said, coaching platforms, test prep platforms in India, etc. Right now is almost similar to test prep. All these platforms will prepare you for civil services, IIT exam. The medical science exams are the ones that are leading, which also shows that our society's preference is still a lot towards the conventional career options.
1657121652.0-1657162694.0
Not a bad thing to happen, but it really harms when 14 lakh students, let's say if the medical science exams, there are hardly one and a half lack seats, not even that around 1.2 lakh seats, one Lakh seats in India, including the private and the government seats. Where do the other 13 lakh students go? Now obviously some of them who are financially well off can send their kids to Russia or Ukraine or some other country where there's cheaper medical education available and good quality. But how do these rural area students cope up with that? So sometimes choosing a conventional career option becomes a much higher risk than it seems like and following your passion is much lower of a risk.
1657162822.0-1657206406.0
Now this perspective, if we can do a very good job at spreading, then the career counseling companies, and I bet you very hard on this, that the career counseling companies can become the biggest companies in ITC across India. Because everything starts from career counseling, the movement, career counseling as an industry starts to be perceived as a must have. That is the day that all the by Jews and academies of the world either have to become the best at career counseling or have to acquire a company like us, or one of us is the leaders in the tech ecosystem, because everything starts from career counseling. If I have a career plan of a student, I know what is the percentage that he or she wants to score? So we can then help him with tuitions.
1657206438.0-1657222430.0
We can then help him with coaching as well. Or her. If a student wants to take up a certain career option, we can help him or her with the degrees and the admissions. If a student wants to prepare for a certain entrance examination, we can refer him or her to a coaching. The opportunity is huge.
1657222580.0-1657257146.0
And then we can also do a much better job at actually helping the student figure out the boardmarks, the entrance examination, the skills and employment. So I think it becomes very structured that way. And that's why my bet as a career counseling company owner is that in the next five to ten years, the biggest etc company of India will be the company which is the best at career counseling in India. Absolutely makes sense. I am personally really excited to see that happening because we are just so tired of seeing test reps, like you said, test prep and coaching platforms being at the top, and they're just pushing the same things, same thing.
1657257328.0-1657274650.0
And we want to get the opportunity to even explore professionals like journalism, which is supposed to be mainstream, but it isn't. It isn't, right? So I really hope we get to see that. And we're almost at the end of our time today at this time. I enjoyed this conversation.
1657274730.0-1657298226.0
I mean, as a person. Like I said, when I was associated with an organization, I saw these problems happening first hand, and I'm so glad there are platforms like this now to help those students grow as much as they have the potential to do. So I really enjoy our conversation, and I hope I see you back on our platform soon. Talk more. Thank you so much, anti.
1657298258.0-1657313518.0
I also enjoyed being on this platform. Thank you so much to the audience for interacting so actively with us. And, yeah, looking forward to more future conversations like this. See you soon back on the platform. Thank you so much.
1657313684.0-1657316140.0
Thank you so much, Auntie. Thank you so much to the audience. Take care, everyone.

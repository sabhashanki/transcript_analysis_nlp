Hello and welcome everybody. Welcome to Kool K. This is the second episode of Culture Chronicles and we have with us two of my former colleagues and music journalists. Shunashi sen in karishma quinzank. Sunashir works with the Rolling Stone india and Karishma works with HT Branch.
1652919226.0-1652937810.0
Welcome, Sunashir, karishma, it's wonderful to have you here. Thank you for having us. I guess that's the right thing to say. This is going to be a fun conversation since I know both of you and I've worked with the two of you. So, yeah, it's great to have you here.
1652937900.0-1652965914.0
So why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, your career so far, especially when it comes to music writing. Soon. Ashi, why don't we start with you? Actually, I started off with newspapers, like traditional newspapers, and then my music writing began in the UK when I went there for a broadcast journalism course. So after the course, I didn't get a job in journalism because of various factors.
1652966042.0-1653005486.0
Maybe because I wasn't qualified enough, maybe because it was recession, maybe because the Tories had said that they're going to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands from the hundreds of thousands. So I started working in different jobs, like at a farm, at a supermarket, which is the most soul sucking job I've ever done in my life, at a bookshop, which wasn't that bad. But then there was this magazine back then which was a pledging magazine called Clash. So I reached out to them saying that I want to write for you as a freelancer. So the deal they gave me was that, okay, sure, but we are not going to pay you anything except that we're going to pay for your tickets for whatever show that we want you to cover.
1653005588.0-1653032466.0
So I was like, no problem, because sometimes you have these awesome shows in the UK, eddie Weather, people like that, and the tickets themselves were like Â£150 and stuff like that. So I was like, fine, and that's the limitation I'm getting. I'm happy to do it. So then I started writing for Clash and that's when I started writing for music. But then I came back to India and then I joined the Statesman in Calcutta, which in retrospect was a bad roof because it was hanging by a thread.
1653032658.0-1653065760.0
So I came to Bombay and joined actually, I won't name the organization. I joined this web scene which belongs to a pretty big music company, thinking that it's independent music journalism. But very soon I realized that they are basically using that web scene as a mouthpiece for their own artists and their own brand promotions. So that continued. Then I went back to newspapers and then it's only when I joined Midday about four and a half years ago that I got to write about music on a regular basis and then that eventually led to the Rolling Stone job.
1653066290.0-1653082520.0
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you're a music writer and like, you're young, then, like, don't feel afraid or don't shy away from writing for free because you never know whether that's going to get you. Because all these violets that I got from Clash Music are eventually what helped me get the job at midday first, and then it's almost.
1653084570.0-1653103550.0
Yeah, as long as it's paying for your tickets, right? Yeah, but I have to pay for my own travel, by the way. It was literally just the tickets. No two and two, no free lunch even. What about you, Karishma?
1653104690.0-1653145610.0
I know you have a background in music as well, so tell us a little bit about that and about how you started writing music. Well, actually, it was the fact that I had a background in music that kind of made me write about music because that was the only thing I felt I knew relatively. So I basically began singing in school, the usual choir, sings, et cetera. Continued that in college. Also had a bunch of piano lessons, did a couple of grades, taught for a couple of years.
1653145760.0-1653170850.0
And then I actually started interning with Delhi Times about a decade ago when it wasn't as paid, if I may. It wasn't as a media net heavy, right? It could actually put in 150 words, which was just about the art. I was like, hey, this is carn. I was in a fourth year of college.
1653170920.0-1653182438.0
I was like, why not give it a shot? Obviously got no money. But it was an amazing experience. It kind of made me kind of realize that, okay, this is what I want to do. Continued that.
1653182524.0-1653219060.0
Went to Jonah School, came back to writing art music, and I was with Express Freer. I was actually working with the National Desk, and music just kind of happened parallelly and that's I realized that I couldn't really do it. So then I went back to Delhi Times, which by that time, unfortunately, was really media net heavy, so not much of music happened there. And then I went to India today, or rather Meal today, which was this newspaper by Shuna was also there. I think he was part of the team that launched it.
1653219910.0-1653246042.0
But yeah, that's where I really started writing about music because they had a section that is dedicated to it, like every week. So they have reviews, album reviews. I was like, who am I to your review this Son's album? But it was great. And honestly, I had a bunch of contacts because I was in the scene when I was a kid, which really did help me kind of see that, you know, they put in so much hard work.
1653246096.0-1653286760.0
And even when we were growing up, we were listening to what like, we were really listening to Indian indie artist because we were our first it was either Bollywood or it was like, I don't know, summer of 69 or something. It is that there was no Indian Indian. Of course you had euphoria and all. But then what we have today is so much more diverse and if I may, authentic new kids coming out and doing wonderful stuff. But I guess more on that later.
1653287210.0-1653300710.0
Then I went to of course I came to midday, met you guys, went tuna shir. And I think when I started reading his coverage, he wrote about music. I was like, Dan.
1653318390.0-1653336918.0
Think both of you karishma right now still does other stuff. Doesn't write only music, I think. Sunashi, you've now come to a place where you are writing only music, but you weren't for the longest time. It was one of the things you're doing. So is it possible to live off music writing in India at the moment?
1653337004.0-1653364914.0
Is it possible for somebody to just be a music writer and maybe not get into another beat at all? Yes, if you're living in your parents house, unless you're working for Rolling Stone India. Yeah, I think Rolling Stone India is one of the last remaining music magazine guys we don't have. People don't realize this, but Block Street Journal is still there. It's still there.
1653365032.0-1653382310.0
Yeah, it's still there. They are actually the OG, so to speak, but they're still around. I don't know if they're going to like it'll probably be the same amount of money that you'll get, which I got at Clash, which is basically zero for writing.
1653386170.0-1653430710.0
They are also hanging my thread, but they're still around. There are actually a lot of these smaller players who come in who have a lot of admiration for, like, if I can name some, the Indian Music Diaries is this platform that was started by this guy called Lakshi Kapoor. I think it was back in 2015 or something that he started it. And it was pretty pledging back then that he gave a voice to people from every corner of the country and then very organically built up his platform from ground level. And then now he's become this source of information even for people like us, I guess Parishmal said, I'm pretty sure logs onto the Indian music ideas on Instagram to find out what's going on in the indie scene.
1653431210.0-1653459230.0
But then again, my problem is that the mainstream newspapers really don't give I mean, we live in a country where, like, you know, Tamoor Khan, like, digs his nose. Like, tell me a million people like that makes buying belly times, for instance. But if like, there's this unique ass metal band playing in their city, like, they would turn the page so they wouldn't read about the band. So that's I think of the problem. Like the audience gets what it deserves, to be honest.
1653459300.0-1653487334.0
So once the mainstream newspapers realize that there is an audience, good, and once the audience itself wakes up with the idea that this is the actual journalism, then I think we have something to talk about. I think even now, I mean, it's a two way thing, right? Even in mainstream publications, the moment you pitch a music story, they're always trying to look for that Bollywood connect. Look for a popular connect. Yeah, I think not.
1653487372.0-1653513206.0
How many followers, but who have they worked with? Have they worked in an event series? Now, that's the next level now. But do you think the web series space has also given more space to some of these artists? I remember these, especially when I met tourist, and even like a film like Geraya had an independent artist playing.
1653513258.0-1653560560.0
So is that helping or is that working against the whole indie scene? I think, if I may jump in, I think we've always had Indian kind of trickling into Bollywood, and Bollywood has always kind of given it a little bit of masala and made a little more mainstream. And yes, web series has opened up that space to, like, individual artists. But then I think, again, the reach of that is also limited. As of now, those people who have the kind of contacts, who have, well, made the effort to go to Bombay and figure out their field, I think that's how it's working as of now.
1653563330.0-1653583800.0
It's interesting that you said garray. I think that's actually a pretty big step, because one of the problems that I find with the Indian independent industry is that there are artists who take great pride in being indy and not mainstream. And if they expect to get money. With their attitude of this, then they. Might as well stay with their parents for the rest of their life.
1653584170.0-1653624382.0
So it's very important. I feel like there will be lots of people who probably cascade me for saying this, but I think it's very important to sometimes accept the Winstreet. And my brother had once told me something, my younger brother, I asked him what he said he's coming to Bollywood and he's going to start making AdJingles. So he told me that when I make a jingles, that I will bring my own Indian independent music flavor, like my prop rock guitar sounds, to add jingles to make that sound more palatable to a larger audience. So if the Indian independent musicians have that attitude that they don't consider the mainstream to be an enemy.
1653624526.0-1653663550.0
Except I'd rather a vehicle to actually find a space for themselves where their music gets noticed, as opposed to gets played at a gig where they're ten people, then that's probably the best way forward for the industry in Africa. You're saying that it's okay to accept the mainstream, and it's in fact essential to do that without letting go of what your original sound may be. A lot of people are going to be like, oh, I can't believe you brought this name up. Look at what Pate Kohar is doing. I'm sorry, but he's found, like, a balance doing both.
1653663620.0-1653674574.0
Yeah. Okay. From a place of privilege that not many people but he's got like his strategy, his marketing strategy is there. It's like balance. You need to get that balance.
1653674622.0-1653698650.0
Yes, they pay a hell lot. Do your venue gifts, but balance it out. Take that money. I think he recently made a statement. I'm not sure if it was for Rolling Stone, but he made a statement saying, I want to make money because that's what lets me choose.
1653698800.0-1653700620.0
I want to make lots of money.
1653703810.0-1653706030.0
I assumed it was Rolling Stone.
1653713030.0-1653741290.0
Yeah, I think that made a lot of sense, that once you are sitting on some money, then you get to make those choices. You can choose Nasorasa, but you have to. And he said that money gives you independence, which is honestly true, whether you're a musician or a journalist or whatever. Like, you do need money in order to make choices. Honest Hemingway, who said that the most important writer is to not give up on his day job.
1653741360.0-1653754374.0
So that's what he was getting at. That's also what I was getting at in terms of independent musicians needing to accept the mainstream. Like Ope, for instance. He actually, Kirshman was talking about the balance. That particular instruct.
1653754502.0-1653776520.0
I thought Ope also struck the same sort of balance with Geraya, where the soundtrack wasn't your commercial free. Some kind of Bollywood soundtrack. There was a distinct indie flavor to the songs that was very refreshing to me. Right? Yeah.
1653776890.0-1653796490.0
It sort of almost instantly forced you to look up who did the music, because it sounded like nothing we'd heard in Bollywood before. Yeah. And in Bollywood also. Conversely, Bollywood also has to accept that sound. And I'm sure that Bollywood is now opening up to that sound because otherwise I wouldn't get that gift.
1653797070.0-1653836710.0
We've always had people like Indian independent musicians playing as sessions artists for Bollywood songs, but they never have their own voice in those songs. So now it's important for those musicians to find their voice and incorporate their own voice in those songs instead of blindly following the composers. Like if you in the Louis Banks, for instance, would follow whatever Rd Bubble told him, but also bring in his own favor, but he has an exception. Other people would just follow whatever the composer told them to play. Now those people need to have their own voice and start bridging that gap, essentially, between India and mainstream.
1653838990.0-1653862654.0
I think we have enough examples of people who have managed to do that also. But one more thing that I want to go into little in depth is there is music writing happening in India. There is some amount of it in mainstream media. There are sections in magazines, all of that. There are music magazines, as we can see.
1653862772.0-1653872530.0
But what about the quality? What do you think about the quality of the writing? And I also want to go into what do you think is missing?
1653880010.0-1653895866.0
Firstly, it has to be informative. Let's not forget that your primary goal is to give information, check people's names, check their proper spellings, number of errors. That creepwain. I'm like guys. No.
1653896048.0-1653917738.0
You know, because for many of them, it's like, you know, here, this is one of the few pieces that I'll be featured in in a year because I have worked on single and now I'm marketing it. The next one is going to come out in three, four months. So they put in a lot of hard work. That's the first thing that we should kind of get right. What else is this?
1653917924.0-1653938280.0
Don't always go looking for an angle. It's great if you find an angle, but it doesn't all have to be controversial. Dig into what the musician is trying to say. Yeah, I think that's about it. I don't want to go on, but why don't you tell me?
1653939230.0-1653976370.0
I think what's essentially missing in Indian music writing is the fact that people haven't yet found a flavor, if you know what I mean. I find that articles in India don't have that flavor, which you find in writing in the west where they can actually tell a story. Like when you're talking to a musician and you're interviewing a musician, it's not like, okay, I like this guy. He said this and asked him that, and that's it. You have to really dig deep into where that guy comes from and try and build a narrative about who this person is so that the reader also has an understanding of what the story behind the musician is.
1653976520.0-1654007406.0
So like music writing in India, I think this is that storytelling element right now. If you're a music writer and you can tell a story, whether it's even a gig can be turned into a story, right? So if you go Henderson for gig and then turn the gig into a story, then you stand a better chance of the article being read by more people. Instead of just saying that they played this song first, they played that song second and that song third. Then the lights went off and the audience said instead of that.
1654007428.0-1654038634.0
If you build a narrative in your article to give it a sense of flavor and also your own voice, you have to find your own voice. It's not easy to do, but it takes a bit of time. But if you can find it your own voice and then add that favor to your writing and deliver narrative and a story around your article, then that's what's missing in Indian writing. Exactly what he said. Because when I read Shunashiran's music stories, that's what I get.
1654038672.0-1654061134.0
I get a story. And it helps me understand the musician's music better. And that, I think, is what your music should do to writing about a musician. So basically you're saying what we're seeing now is largely reportage. There is no feature writing per se.
1654061172.0-1654080498.0
That's happening in exactly what I was going to get at because what is music journalism? It's actually features journalism. And what is features journalism? Features journalism is the area of journalism where you can actually have the freedom to tell a story. Like if it's straight up like hard news, then you follow the what went wire how model.
1654080584.0-1654090166.0
Right? Because that's what the reporting is all about. When the fire broke out here, these many people died. This is what the pops have to say and this is what the accuser said. Simple.
1654090268.0-1654113600.0
Done. But in features reporting is when you can actually build a narrative, tell a story, like add some flavor to the conversation, which is essentially what you're having with the reader, right? Like when you're writing an article, you're essentially talking to that one person who's reading the art. So that conversational aspect is something which features journalism allows you, which I feel more music writers in India should take advantage of.
1654116550.0-1654154510.0
But this is for both of you. Are there writers in India who you tend to follow, music writers who you follow and whose work you admire or you sort of think is in the right direction, if not already there in terms of what there should be? Thank you, Krishna. But actually, like the bottom Krishna, there are some people, I mean, like the entire Rolling Stone India staff, obviously, because they are really dedicated to what they're doing. There's anura Taggart on the team.
1654154580.0-1654195770.0
There's David Bitter on the team who are super dedicated towards actually giving Indian inventory music a platform. Then we have these Kpop writers like Devastri Ditti Chakraboti, Vivian Shah Eska, who are absolutely crazy about Kpop and who are really in depth into it. And they are pretty much the only team in the country who are giving the Kpop fan base in the country a platform to actually find news from within the country. Apart from that, there's Ahmed Bulbark Sonny, who has a lot of admission. He's the guy who really goes in depth into the researching aspect of the England independent music industry.
1654196830.0-1654205840.0
That's pretty much it. That's a pretty short list. But I guess. I think he stopped writing right now.
1654209890.0-1654239858.0
He's just given up on the game and he's become this case man, I think somewhere. Yeah, I think there was. But I do remember, I think maybe it was last year or the year before that he wrote this oral history piece on Punjabi MC's song Mundyattabai, which was tracing the history of how that song came to be and how it came to India. I think that was quite interesting. Karishma.
1654239874.0-1654255470.0
Nobody else. Only Shunashi. Literally. There are like three people from the list that he's already mentioned that I follow apart from him, that my list is even shorter. Right?
1654255540.0-1654315054.0
No, but I quite agree with Karishma that that is one thing that's never been missing from your pieces. Whatever you're writing about, whether it was music or food, there is an element of you, I get a sense of what state of mind you were in or what you were thinking when you actually went to a gig or went to a review. It adds a bit of flavor when you're not removing yourself and treating it like reporters, when you're not treating the writing like that. I think even the reader would like a more personal storytelling approach to the written piece than an impersonal gig review where you just talk about like, the number of songs and like, you know, in a total logical order, like they're looking for like, you know, day one. Then think of it like if you're going for a game and you're writing about it and somebody hasn't been for the game, then they would like to put themselves in your shoes, right?
1654315172.0-1654335640.0
They would actually want to be at the gate through the article that you've written. So if you remove yourself from the article, then that person won't be able to get into your shoes to be at the gig while reading the article. So I think that's important. So that sense of labor which I was talking about is the sense of reading that journalism gives you is something really.
1654338250.0-1654362830.0
Do you think it has something to do with the fact that even journalism schools don't really train you in feature writing? And there's that much of an emphasis on objectivity where it's constantly drilled down that you're required to be objective remove yourself from the piece. Which they're all things that work great. With news but not as much with features. Do you think that has a role to play?
1654362900.0-1654387560.0
Was that your experience when you get it? Because you've been to jungle in school? I mean, that also comes from a place where teachers is not seen as serious journalism and as important. So I guess that's where the problem begins. And if not many people aspire to write about something, it's like you can't write about anything.
1654398010.0-1654418298.0
But honestly, is it really not life and death? Is covering features not life and death anymore? I don't know. Everything is but let's not go there. But no, the full attitude needs to change and only then will you actually focus on that's.
1654418314.0-1654445820.0
The attitude that wouldn't we change that's? I just want to make understand what Kashmir saying. This is what she's saying that in agreement with her. So I was saying that let's say your journalist working for a newspaper and you make a really big mistake in a political piece of news, then the owner of the newspaper is liable to satch you. While if you make a mistake in a features article, then all you'll get is a cap and dry r.
1654446270.0-1654474178.0
That's. Very true, depending on who that person is. But it's just a thing that's there that you won't get somebody jailed. Hopefully, even if there is an error, it's more likely that you will see a correspondent for a new story than a feature story that will let it pass. And then for a feature story.
1654474264.0-1654478390.0
Yes, you'll just let it pass. I think that is that element.
1654480490.0-1654508240.0
So I want to understand, since you said there's very little music writing that you actually want to read in India, very little that is good enough to be read. How do you follow what's going around? I mean, you both of you are. Absolutely cluding at any given time as to who's doing what, what kind of gigs are happening and where is there a process you follow for that process?
1654510290.0-1654533382.0
Okay, then I think for me, honestly, it's a little biased. I've had the privilege of being around musicians since I was a teenager, and those musicians have made it. So I'm like, okay, cool, everybody go make it them. Just like, keeping in touch, going, attending gigs, not being like, I'm not going to attend gigs, I'm going to sit here and write about it. That's not going to work.
1654533436.0-1654545980.0
You actually have to go. And I mean, the only way you are actually going to write about it. Is if you enjoy music. If you don't, then you won't be able to write about it. Right, yeah.
1654550830.0-1654561502.0
I really need to emphasize what she said. You have to attend. You can't sit at home and be a music journal. You have to go out there. You have to meet people.
1654561636.0-1654582790.0
Once you meet people, you find out about what's happening in the industry once you find out about what's happening in the industry, that you get a sense of what the industry is all about. And then you can actually write for the more holistic point of view instead of being involved. Well, right. Otherwise you just have to depend on PR news. You're trying to push out whatever artists here, like marketing.
1654585610.0-1654599754.0
Sorry, those are people who already have the money to get a PR person. That person does. Not exactly. But where will you find that one? Talent like, which you saw at the neighborhood pub is going to get big in the future.
1654599952.0-1654612830.0
Unless you go out and attend the game and unless you actually meet people in the industry who tell you that, oh, by the way, there's this guy. You might not know about him, and you should check him out. And here's the name of this song. I'm sending you the link. And WhatsApping is the link?
1654612900.0-1654635414.0
And then you go home and you put it on and you find out that this guy, like, this young fellow from Rifford or whatever, he's somebody to watch out for in the future. And then for all, you know, like, seven years later, he might be the next journalist. Have to be ahead of the curve in that sense. Right. And you can't be ahead of the curve unless you set out a home on the ten gigs and meet people.
1654635452.0-1654649270.0
So networking is very important. Right. So, I mean, for something like this, do you sometimes avoid the popular ones? Do you sometimes deliberately go looking for the smaller gigs? Just go for every gift.
1654649770.0-1654699974.0
That's pretty saying that for all you know, that the opening app for a big name might actually be a fine for you. So you have to be open to that idea as well. It's not like you have at 08:00 when the main headline is supposed to come on and listen and be open. To the gig sooner drags you too right? You're like, yes, I'm coming.
1654700012.0-1654700630.0
Don't.
1654710370.0-1654724020.0
I think your voice is breaking a little. Am I breaking up? Yeah, a little bit. If your internet is stable, then I think you can exit and come again. Sometimes that works.
1654726310.0-1654733586.0
There's a problem. I can hear you fine. Pratchy when I'm talking right now. Can you not hear me? There's a bit of a delay.
1654733778.0-1654735030.0
There's a delay.
1654739210.0-1654752294.0
So while Shannon figures it out, there is something that networking. Reminds me of something that I do every week. Diligently, I'm going to do this. I go to the caravan. Jazz clock.
1654752342.0-1654792354.0
It's this lovely venue in Delhi in South Jangan. Cave does have a branch guru, but I go to South Junghwan every Sunday because they have something called the jam session. They have the house band play for like an hour and then they open the stage to musicians. So usually you will find a lot of Indian musicians there, go there, watch them on stage. I have seen, like, 13 year olds, like kids, I mean, 13 year old kids who are now 19 and bloody brilliant, you know, and literally, to see them grow up, like, literally watching them every week has been a privilege.
1654792482.0-1654816286.0
But network is is really important. I don't go there and talk to everybody, but just go there and see what's happening and you get to know who's doing what, who's working with whom. And sometimes just observing that dynamic can also be quite interesting. And it starts making sense musically. You're like, oh, that person, that person sound is like this, that person might want to work with this person.
1654816388.0-1654838518.0
Next thing it's happening, you're like, hey, and also follow up. Always follow up. Don't be like, I met some musician three months ago and then forget about it. If you like someone, someone sound, go back home, look them up on Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, go stalk the hell out of the WeSTOCK. Everyone else, do this for your own good.
1654838604.0-1654850122.0
Find some good music to listen to. Really helps with working. You know that I listen to music when I work. Is Shunashi back or is she still away? Anyway?
1654850176.0-1654869378.0
So that's one thing. When you do listen to these jam sessions, has there been a time where you've heard a particular artist at a jam session and the artists have gone on to become really big after that? Yeah. So Ms Roy, he was there in Galai also. I rapped for the first time.
1654869544.0-1654888790.0
I think it was the first time he was rapping publicly too, and he went bloody killed. It. Okay. And now he was very active during the ants that were happening at Rainbow. Just brilliant work, brilliant stuff.
1654888940.0-1654901420.0
And that's just one of the people. There are so many musicians who are. Doing a brilliant job playing with everyone and anyone. We have Abheshan MoS playing with Chunk and Loy now. So many people.
1654902190.0-1654923422.0
Yeah. Welcome back. What about you? I was just asking Karishma, have there been times where you've seen an artist in the early stages of their career just jam and they've gone to become really big at a small gig? She was talking about the Piano Man jam sessions.
1654923566.0-1654930840.0
So has that happened with you also where you watched an artist before they became the big deal that they are now?
1654934010.0-1654940760.0
Can you hear me? So I think there's something here. Just text it and come back over. What's? It okay.
1654942670.0-1654944300.0
Can you hear us now?
1654948670.0-1654952320.0
I think he's frozen. Great.
1654954450.0-1654956160.0
Can I wait?
1654958770.0-1654979000.0
Tell him the ghost I'm near, he's. Going to come back. So yeah. So I will ask you this also, but I want to ask you, what kind of music do you personally like and what are some of the indie artists who you really admire? The sound that you personally like.
1654979450.0-1655007758.0
So, interestingly enough, if I'm working on a music interview, whether it's an interview where it's a gig review, like whatever the sensing music related, I make it a point to actually listen to the artist before, of course, but also while writing that day, it's just an easy way of getting their vibe and remembering it and going with the flow. And it really does help. Okay, she does that. Yeah. So you can hear me.
1655007764.0-1655008480.0
No problem.
1655012530.0-1655035180.0
Okay, whatever it is, you figured it out now, so it works. So I was asking Karish, man, I want to come to you also about this. What kind of music do you personally like and with Charge, some of the indie artists who you admire in the scene currently, I think Karishma, you can go ahead. Problem?
1655037470.0-1655043120.0
Let me just try on my phone. All right, he'll be back. I'm going to continue.
1655046450.0-1655073320.0
Apart from doing that strange thing, which actually really helps, I listen to a lot of songs on if I find an artist, I listen to their songs over and over again. And some of the artists that I love listening to are well, that's Kamakshi Kana. She's a beautiful songwriter. I love her voice. Sabah Chucky again very early.
1655074410.0-1655092160.0
Genuine. When you listen to him, you feel the purerness and the genuineness coming through. It just makes you smile, like, no matter what, just that. Who else that is, of course you can't hear me. Are you here?
1655093410.0-1655098942.0
No, we can't hear you. And he's gone. Okay. So yeah. Any others?
1655098996.0-1655111860.0
You said tawashaki. Yeah, I already went to Tavashaki. I already went to Kavakshi. Who else is there who I listen to, like, almost every day? There's a huge list.
1655112710.0-1655130078.0
So 1 second I think Kamakshi Khan opened for luckily, right, last weekend in Monday. Three days ago. Yeah. Singer Kamakshi. There's also Komaridi or Tarana, marga and Avidasha thin.
1655130114.0-1655150270.0
And all three of them used to sing together in college and it was just beautiful. I really miss choirs. I don't think we have that in my God, it's so beautiful to be part of one and just listen to one. The Harvey is coming in together. There's also stages men in I love Basra.
1655151250.0-1655161410.0
VI Basra. She is brilliant. Lucia. Lucia is phenomenal. She is this musician and vocalist who's based out of Delhi.
1655161830.0-1655181530.0
Then there's this really old school fun band who I have watched Growth since they were in college and I was in college called Five Eight. They're brilliant. Recently, I mean, I don't think they've done the gig in a while. But again, like, amazing bunch of musicians, all of this pursuing music. Who else is that through Vishwanath.
1655181950.0-1655194734.0
Again, he's phenomenal. Teddy based. He's got a nice or the pop bluesy vibe and I just like soul and it's just okay then. Now? Should I go on?
1655194772.0-1655217170.0
I can go on. I'm sure you have many, but I think these are enough a good set of recommendations to go with for anybody who's listening in to start on. If you're looking to start listening to the indie circuit, this might be a good place. I'll send you my playlist. I'll be like, yeah, but don't listen to the playlist.
1655217250.0-1655231290.0
Go watch them live. Because these are people who can actually perform live and my God, it is beautiful. You have to go and sit. Go watch them live. And also the fan killers in Bombay.
1655231950.0-1655243760.0
Amazing. There's also James miracle. I remember he now started his own restaurant called Jazzy James. Oh, okay. No, I'm not aware of this.
1655244210.0-1655256062.0
He cooks amazingly. He's a brilliant musician. I'm like, great. Perfect. There's also Kadhim, there is Anuragnadu Bus, all these guys who are in Bombay.
1655256126.0-1655258530.0
Goa was now in Paris.
1655260950.0-1655264100.0
I think that should I say back?
1655266630.0-1655279834.0
Because it was patching. Yeah, there was something wrong with the router. It never really happened. I think we can hear you now. But honestly, I'm back to like two bars right now.
1655279872.0-1655285420.0
I don't know what's happening. You can hear us now? Yes, we can. Can you hear us?
1655287470.0-1655288780.0
Can you hear us?
1655291070.0-1655307202.0
Okay, I can hear you, but I'm afraid there's something wrong at my end. Let me just hover around a bit and see if I get more bars. Yeah, I'm getting more bars now, so it should be better if I sit here. You might not be able to see me, but there's nothing much to see. That's okay.
1655307256.0-1655315650.0
As long as I think we know that it's you and we can hear you. We'll work with that for now. So I was asking Karishma.
1655317930.0-1655353210.0
Karishma gave us a huge list of artists that she liked. Why don't you also tell us what kind of music you like and what are some of the indie acts that you really admire and you think people should listen to? Can you ask about what kind of music I like? Coming back to music journalism as a subject, I think it's really important for a music journalist to keep their ears open for any and every kind of music. Whether it's death metal, whether it's like mainstream pop, whether it's like alternative stuff, whether it's like Indian classical.
1655353370.0-1655381930.0
I think the most simple thing for music journalists is to have the ears open for all kinds of music and not be judgmental about any one kind of music over another. Because then you are limiting your own playing field, right. Because you're trying to cover as much as possible and give a whole rounded perspective of what music in the country entails. So if you ask me what my favorite genre is, I'd say every genre, them. But personally, you're entitled to your choice.
1655385150.0-1655388300.0
I can name my favorite band. I can do that.
1655391790.0-1655413314.0
Shouldn't have five acts. You want to watch life before you die? Actually, one of those acts I'm privileged enough to already have watched the stroke that kind of changed my life. Another one of those acts as an act never get to watch because they've despendent, which is dark punk. And that's what I'm saying.
1655413352.0-1655419480.0
The Strokes are very different from dark punk. Right? So, I mean, that's my point. You have to be open to all sorts of music.
1655421610.0-1655424680.0
I'd love to see OSS, but that's not going to happen either.
1655426810.0-1655441274.0
Although I'm looking forward to Liam Gallagher's album on the 27 May, which is coming out indian Acts. I don't know. I really like the SuperSonics. The SuperSonics were a great band. I think they would have really gone places.
1655441322.0-1655456370.0
But then, like, it happens with bands like Internal Differences, the demise of a band. Remember this band? Was something relevant. No, I haven't actually heard of them. Dude, what are you saying?
1655456440.0-1655460450.0
It had Ryan sadhguri. It had JJ. Fucking brilliant.
1655463190.0-1655465990.0
Sorry. Go ahead. So then you know my number, Krishna.
1655472890.0-1655482780.0
The thing is, I have everybody's number, but nobody has mine. So I'm in this position of power. Yeah. I also like Peter Cat recording company a lot.
1655486990.0-1655506980.0
I like Warren Mendoza's guitar playing a lot. These are the Indian bands I like. Yeah. Okay, from both of you. One particular artist who you think is going to go a long way is probably not there yet, but one that you can call right now.
1655516870.0-1655525720.0
We both named you. Actually, another subject. I'm talking to two women and you guys haven't got up the lack of representation of women in the industry. But let's not get them.
1655528970.0-1655543950.0
With this. Dot is also the one who is. In the arches, in the new arches one. I was quite surprised to see her because she didn't see the sort who put herself out there like that. She's got recluse.
1655545490.0-1655550080.0
She's realizing that money lies self not in Indian independent music.
1655552850.0-1655576360.0
But look at who the composer for it is. He's another example of a guy who's actually found the right balance between the mainstream and Indian India. He plays his gigs with Ankur and the Guard family in pubs and clubs. But then he also collaborated with the Zoayakalpur Nachi is all with Gully Boy, which is pretty much astream as it gets. So why not is my question.
1655576970.0-1655591840.0
And I think he is one of those people who's been doing that for the longest time. Like even the earlier Rajith Kapoor films, there was always either he was doing the background score or he was actually doing the music. There was always some Bollywood component going on.
1655594130.0-1655609406.0
He used to work for like MTV as well. And MTV is also like a commercial platform, right? An Indian independent musician doesn't necessarily have to play gigs and make music to support themselves through the industry. Like there are so many avenues. Like raghav.
1655609438.0-1655626840.0
Metal is another example. Like, he's a single songwriter, but he makes his money from music management, essentially. So why not as an Indian musician, why not try those routes as well? It's not necessarily that you always have to make music to make money because anyway, you're not going to make much money if you're breaking music. Only.
1655631050.0-1655654462.0
A lot of people right now are, you know, doing the pandemic has given objects to this time and space to sit at home and learn how to do their own mixing, their own production. And that's saving them so much money. So just that like, there are so many skills you can just things you can do. Like, I know so many musicians who are teaching. They're teaching that's true.
1655654596.0-1655671030.0
They're teaching schools or they're doing taking classes. They're doing what they love. They are doing a great thing by actually imparting that skill and teaching that skill to somebody else. And they're doing the gigs that they want to. So there are so many things you can do.
1655671100.0-1655683546.0
And then you have I have a. Friend who's a music teacher himself. Like, he was actually in the Supersonic. Like, he tells me that when he's teaching, he's learning more than he ever does. So when you are teaching, you're learning as well, right?
1655683728.0-1655691100.0
If you're picking up skills as a producer, then again you're learning. You're not just like upskilling yourself, but you're also essentially educating yourself.
1655696110.0-1655734614.0
No, as a musician, you also really have to, like, remember that it's going to be a process where you're always learning. And as long as you are okay with that and are not up to a subset here, that's how you're going. To I guess that makes sense since we're on the subject of personal choices also, besides these one or two of your most memorable gigs and why for. Me, the Strokes, it changed my life. I couldn't imagine.
1655734662.0-1655762660.0
Actually, my first ever truly quality live experience was when I went to the UK and went to my first gig, it was Corner Shop. The same guys who get grim full of Russia, right? Then I realized what music production at a Western scale, and no offense meant to any Indian band, but there are some bands out in the west who are at a different level. So that's when I realized what the scale of a concert can be. And I really hope that we as a country reach that place as soon as possible.
1655763030.0-1655798174.0
So Corner Shop was my first experience with music, live music in the west that changed my life. And then when I went for the Strokes, I realized that what scale these guys operate, we are actually very far from there, to be honest. Any of the Indian artists that you sort of had that experience with? Yeah, the SuperSonics, when they launched their album Heads Up at Blue Frog, that was a great gig. And then when PCRC launched, there was there we went for that together.
1655798372.0-1655806900.0
PCRC launched witchmilla g five A. That's a wonderful venue to have a music launch at.
1655809350.0-1655828790.0
To be honest. It proves that it was a great gig because you're not allowed beer at the venue. So I was told sober, had the time of my life. Okay, that's saying something. What about you, Karishma, what have been your most memorable gig?
1655829130.0-1655867510.0
Well, the PCRT gig, I went with Shunna for sure in Bombay because I think it was the first gig in Bombay that I really, truly enjoyed. And I had been spoilt for Choice in Delhi, if I may, because when I talk about one gig that changed my life, it's got to be I'm going to say it, it's got to be the launch of the Paramount Jazz Club about six to seven years ago. I think seven years ago in September or August. And I remember going there, I was like, just another venue going to launch. I went there and I was like, oh, it looks nice, looks cool, looks different, cozy.
1655867850.0-1655898800.0
And then the music started and I was standing in some corner pushed somewhere and there were so many people and I was like Kush Sunai to the Nanny Ballachitari. And I'm standing there and I can hear everything crystal clear, like the band, like, I'm sitting there with the band and they're playing it and I was like, whoa, this is the kind of sound that I want. I want to hear every note. And then the owner asked everybody to shut up for a song. He was like, the bar is going to shut down.
1655899410.0-1655922966.0
Everyone's going to shut up. If you want to talk, get out. Come back after this song and respect the musicians on stage for the sheer joy that they're providing you all evening. A garnetly took up his unlock and that I was like a spoiled because now I can't go and listen to music anywhere because I'm like with a. Lot of noise and everything.
1655923148.0-1655943894.0
Yeah, it has to be top notch and b, like, just the fact that there's someone there going to be like, shut up. Respect. Musicians don't treat them as part of furniture because there is such a thing when it comes to our society. So, yeah, there you are, too. But any particular artist that you've really enjoyed?
1655943942.0-1655960690.0
I'm not in the last few years because of the pandemic, but before that. Akash Vincent, he hasn't been playing for a while. He came out with, if I'm not mistaken, one album and an EP. Brilliant guy. He's more of a poet.
1655963430.0-1655970850.0
His lyrics are really, really yeah, they do something. And that was one gig. I was like, okay, I'm going to sit here and cry. And I cried.
1655974150.0-1655977010.0
And the day I discovered cleaning wild.
1655990910.0-1656027634.0
Again, I'm on the whole personal choices subject because I think there's a lot to hear there and there's a lot that you probably don't talk about as much. But what's been your most, which is the one piece of music writing that you've enjoyed the most? Something that you've written, that you've enjoyed doing, really enjoyed doing. Actually, I was the guy who broke the news that Justin Bieber lives in India because I was working in DNA at that point in time. So I went for the concert and started my job and then I had to write it on my WhatsApp?
1656027682.0-1656044974.0
And send the entire article as a WhatsApp? Message to the editorial team. And then the paper got printed at 07:00 with my byline saying, Justin, people live synth. So that was my proudest moment as a journalist. Yeah, that's really big news.
1656045012.0-1656045840.0
That's when.
1656051090.0-1656063698.0
I was actually guided. I can beat my own drum. You must. There are rare occasions where a music journalist gets to break news. Yeah, that's true, actually.
1656063864.0-1656080070.0
That is true. So I think that is a big. Move that interviewing John McLaughlin was like a real honor. I don't think too many people have sat down with John McLaughlin for an hour, so, yeah, that was pretty cool. That's wonderful.
1656080230.0-1656083980.0
I can't talk that I'm going to skip this question.
1656087710.0-1656102574.0
I think Juna set the tone for. This little letter was the one who gave an exclusive comment to HC branch. So I guess, like, even it's not. The first time, also. Right.
1656102612.0-1656119622.0
I think you've interviewed him in the past as well. Yeah, and that was two years ago. I remember I was in Bombay, I just joined Brunch and I was like, oh, yeah. And then I was like, I want to do a bigger, better interviewer. I was like, Me, demonstrated, come my way.
1656119676.0-1656135850.0
And then two years. Two years. Those three months really doesn't reach out to the media at all. I don't know what his game is. I was so scared to interview him because I've seen people interview him, like live syllable.
1656136750.0-1656146126.0
You can watch that interview together, literally, like, yes. So and I'm like, oh, God. After I 2000 words. And yesterday was like, essay over. Sat with him for an hour.
1656146148.0-1656147790.0
I was like, you aren't leaving?
1656150610.0-1656161380.0
He was like, what? I was like, yeah, come, it's okay, let's talk. Forget the interview. It's like, okay, those are the best interviews, right? Let's talk about the best interviews anyway.
1656162150.0-1656166120.0
Yeah, the best interviews are when it doesn't feel like an interview and you're just like, okay.
1656168730.0-1656183820.0
Exactly. That's wonderful. I think I just have one last question for the two of you. I think this has been a really interesting and enlightening conversation. I'm going to go back and ask for your playlist very soon.
1656184590.0-1656218070.0
So the last thing I want to ask is for people listening in, are there any upcoming gigs? Upcoming gigs that you really recommend or festivals that people should attend anywhere in the country? Upcoming festivals? I don't think the festival season has. Really come down this time, but any particular solo act or any band that who's playing again now that things are a little better that people should really catch.
1656224950.0-1656233462.0
Okay. And they're back to performing. Yeah. I attended a really kickass crash gate in some way. It brought the house down.
1656233516.0-1656260160.0
My friend, he heard the music in his car and I told him earlier to come and he was like, no man, it doesn't sound that good. So I told him that, just trust me, come for the live gig. These guys bring the house down with the live gig. It's just three guys who are so tight and having so much fun on stage that it's infectious, almost. So if Scott comes to your city, don't miss that gig, right?
1656260530.0-1656272754.0
Anything from you. Parishma. Yeah, I mean, so many artists there's Peter Catacomb course they come to your city. Don't not miss them. Don't make idiots like I was.
1656272792.0-1656285990.0
And they came back to Delhi. Then there is Sanjita buddha is coming out with a new song. Really looking forward to that. I think hopefully she's going to tour force that. There's also this band called the Copycats.
1656286810.0-1656297340.0
They don't have originals, but they do brilliant covers and I mean, you're going to be dancing and of course come for the jam session at the Piano and jazz club and meet me.
1656300430.0-1656314080.0

Anyway, I'm going to close this now. Thanks so much, Karishma. Thanks so much, Sunashi, for being here. This has been a really enjoyable conversation and I hope there's a lot of music big people are taking back from here and filling up their playlist with. Thanks so much.

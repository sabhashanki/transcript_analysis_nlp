1654684610.0-1654712058.0
So essentially, to sum up a little bit about monkey pox, pardon me, we don't have cases reported in India, and the government is alert about it. Citizens have been notified. And if we get something, we have the diagnostics. Is that the basic premise at this moment? Yes, pala because we don't have a drug being an antiviral viral disease, we don't have drugs.
1654712074.0-1654741826.0
So there is a drug which is available globally, but the supplies are just too minimal because nobody anticipated this. And this disease actually is self limiting color. So you expect the patient to recover with the usual symptoms of pilot fever for some days and have rash on your face and other parts of body, and then it will gradually subside. But certainly there is a group of people you will always worry about. You'll worry about children, you'll worry about pregnant women, you'll worry about the older population.
1654742018.0-1654760890.0
But in fact, in this maybe the older population, there's a switched site aligned to it. We may not need to worry so much about the older population because all of them are vaccinated with smallpox. Yes, smallpox vaccine has a very high efficacy towards multi leg pillagatha.
1654764430.0-1654797690.0
And so we worried about yes, the younger population more in this case, because of the since 19 80, 81, we've not had any smallpox vaccinations globally. So now, leaving monkeypox out, like you said, we are alert about it. You also work on the area of neglected diseases. Now, many would say most diseases are neglected and we don't have much understanding of many diseases. So within diseases, how do you define what are neglected diseases?
1654798510.0-1654830982.0
Sure, this is nowadays my understanding of helping people understand what are neglected diseases. But you said every disease is neglected. But yes, between the diseases, among that large bucket, the portfolio of diseases, our country suffers from neglected diseases. It should really go by classic definition, who is very beautifully defined, but maybe I'll try to still make it simpler. It's actually something which are ancient diseases.
1654831046.0-1654863010.0
It means they are rarely the oldest diseases hundred of years which have been there. Despite that, we do not have adequate information, we do not have adequate tools to fight them. And the tropical and tropical tropical regions, they have tropical regions. That's where these diseases it's a group of WH calls it a group of 20 diseases and globally, but out of those 20, even India suffers from 1213 of them. That's high numbers.
1654863080.0-1654900590.0
And India has and for some of them, India has a very high burden. And I'll just give you some examples also as I go forward. Palace so we say these are diseases of the real poor marginalized population living in the tropical and subtropical areas. Diseases where you always have these vectors, whether it's a sandfly or it's a mosquito or not all of them, but majority of them have a very complex life cycle. They continue to breathe, they continue to be there and the last point, I would say they're called neglected because there is not much research happening in these areas, because these are the diseases of poor countries.
1654901350.0-1654927910.0
Actually India also, we are not poor, but these are the diseases of the marginalized population within the country. And the larger pharma do not find adequate returns on the investment, I should say, for them to invest in the sector. So that's why we call them neglected tropical diseases. So why is big pharma not interested in it simple. It's nothing about economics.
1654927990.0-1654930300.0
It doesn't make economic sense to them.
1654932350.0-1654972546.0
We all hear right, it takes 1 billion to $2 billion to make a drug, takes a few millions to make a diagnostics when there is no purchasing power of these countries, lots of African countries, lot of Latin American countries, they would not even recover the investment which they will need to make. So therefore, you hear what we look for mainly is not for profits. We look for government support, we look for government research institutes, we look for a lot of CSR funding. Suppose you try to pool all those philanthropic sources and try to work on both developing diagnostics and of course, treatments. So the organization I work for is mainly drugs.
1654972578.0-1655000382.0
We work a lot on drugs and we work with a nationally with the ICMR, the National Control Program. Now, can you name some of the neglected diseases, especially the ones which afflict the Indian population? Most common, which everybody would immediately relate to Palab is dengue and chicken gun ya. Both are fed by mosquitoes. We don't have a drug to treat them right.
1655000436.0-1655018594.0
So that's the reason. The other disease this organization, Drugs for Neglected Diseases, really works on is Kalazar. You would know Kalazar is endemic just in four states of the country. It's there in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Charcoal. And Bihar had the maximum.
1655018642.0-1655050106.0
But thanks to a very large national Kalazar program, our numbers have dramatically come down the last, but we still have the last mile to go, so we really cannot get our guards down. So Kalajar achaphne, I'm sure everybody in the audience would have heard. And as it when I was a child, we used to see lots of those patients with large legs sitting on the railway station. They just can't walk. So we call it eleventhiases, or in the technical language, we call it lymphatic polyesters hathipalm heartipalco.
1655050298.0-1655084806.0
So that is another very large disease. A lot of efforts are being made by the country on the national program. But again, we don't have a drug to kill that worm because it is a worm who, who sheds lots of small babies, microfileray and the blood, and that's what clogs the lymphatic system. So people cannot flow back and their legs or their other parts of body swells up. The other leprosy is still there, Radies is there, there's a fungal infection called My toma.
1655084858.0-1655112278.0
Nobody talks about it, but you'll find so many case reports in her Indian microbiology, or from dermatologists actually palate that even needs amputation at times. It's that severe disease which just gets in with a thorn and it keeps multiply and there is no other option but amputate rather than the disease spreading like this. What lemon held. There is KBS, there is those helmets, we say butchuka, both worms. Ojate, those helmets, lots of helmets.
1655112374.0-1655142790.0
We have the cysts tina worm, we say, or a kind of prophesis. We have the cysts because of the worms. So all types of microbes mean there's what you said, bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal. All types together are collectively called as neglected tropical diseases. What are you doing to get them more attention and get them more funding, more research into so that they no longer remain neglected diseases, but they become diseases which Dr.
1655142860.0-1655145960.0
Kavita worked on and found solutions to.
1655149050.0-1655184190.0
That's very excellent. I wish we could get more interested people like Yup Palava, who wants to talk about neglected diseases. I would really find love to have more champions from within the country, more local voices within the countries, get more attention. We understand we have competing interests in health, but maybe integrate it in a larger health system. We are quite optimistic, although something might change with this wonderful schemes of the wellness centers, primary health care, if early detection can be a mode.
1655184350.0-1655221750.0
But of course, getting attention, getting more financial sources has always been our effort towards this. Now you mentioned dengue and chicken gunia. These are diseases which came under very close scrutiny and national attention when the epidemics were happening in the national capital and all over India. And would you still call them neglected diseases because they became so important in the national dialogue? Yeah, but importance needs to, I would say, seep down into action.
1655221830.0-1655249746.0
Pala, like I said today, even if a patient goes to with the dengue diagnosis, there is no way it is okay to self limited majority of patients. But the patients who have a severe disease, there is no drug to stop that. So we need to find a treatment so that at least the vulnerable population or we are sure that if you are dengue, at least you will not die of dengue. There has to be a treatment for dengue. And there is no large pharma.
1655249778.0-1655267926.0
I think there's one large pharma is working on one drug. But even Palabdirs, those large farmer, they don't want to take it to the last mile of development. I would say not here, not so. There is so much of investment and working in endemic countries. We all understand phase two, phase three clinical trials.
1655268038.0-1655301240.0
So we'll see if we can partner with them or we can have some different strategies. We've started working on this is a new area. We've started working part of the dengue within our organization. We are already partnering with a lot of Indian institutes because a lot of disease knowledge in this part of the world, whether it's India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia so here the leadership will have to come from the local, regional region. We will not be waiting for the west every time, like every time to find a drug for us, we need to take our own diseases into our own hands in terms of work on them.
1655302250.0-1655328480.0
You have rightly pointed out, I was reading somewhere and there was an article in the British Medical Journal which said that India invests, compared to many other countries, a lot of money on these neglected diseases. Is that a fact or is that a hyperbole? So it's a fact. But the way we look at it, the pool of neglected disease funding is so small. It's so small.
1655330390.0-1655358998.0
You're basically looking at the LMICs to fund. So India is a larger donor in that first ICMR. If you know Palav, many ICMR institutes do have they have a whole research in RMR as RMRI partner which works on Kala Azar, there's a whole institute in Chennai which works on lymphatic polyesters. So that's the reason we do have dedicated. But somewhere we need to take that leap of getting out drugs for these diseases.
1655359174.0-1655364650.0
Now, do we have enough surveillance about these diseases in India?
1655368670.0-1655387010.0
The way experts look at it, our numbers are usually underreported. Many of them are not notifiable in fact color. We would be very surprised to know, and I'm sure the audience will be surprised. Till last year even rabies was not notifiable in the country. We don't have the exact number of patients dying from rabies.
1655387590.0-1655411498.0
But like Kalazar, we have an excellent notifiable system, neither black nor white. Some diseases have got the attention like lymphatic viruses and Kalaza or the hearty for what you said. Some of them rabies has just come in, some of them have not. They would certainly could merit with more surveillance because policies can be made only if the data is available. Sure.
1655411584.0-1655443090.0
Now you're talking about diseases which are neglected. Let me come back to a disease which has found and caught the attention not just of India but of the world in the last two years, which is COVID-19 and we still don't have a drug against COVID-19. Trillions of dollars and crores of rupees. Why do we don't have a drug against COVID-19? The Sarscove Two virus we still don't have a drug.
1655445990.0-1655469806.0
You are right palm there have been huge efforts towards it and with the latest some of the drugs which Pfizer has launched or we're expecting Shinogi to launch, they are to some extent but they can't be given to the whole population. They can't be given to there's so many contraindications for the drug. So they don't have the perfect drug. Absolutely. You don't have the perfect shot which can be given to anybody.
1655469908.0-1655492738.0
We don't have that today. I would say the bug is too smart. This RNA virus with its ability to mutate it's not only coronavirus or Sarscovia two all Rnavirus chinchill genetic material is RNA. They mutate so rapidly that the lovely thing we have for bacteria is we have broad spectrum antibacterial. It doesn't have to be for E.
1655492744.0-1655517522.0
Coli, separate clips, separate pseudomora, there's so many names of bacteria. It doesn't have to be a separate antibacterial for all of we just have one for gram negatives, one for both gram negatives and positives. But here we don't have any prospect of antiviral. Firstly, even till now there are lots of reasons. One of the reason is that viruses either have one genetic material they don't have a lot of their own machinery.
1655517606.0-1655541358.0
So for any drug to attack, you can attack only if it has a point of attack. So those points of attacks are very few, very few. Because it multiplies inside a human host, it is not something which can multiply outside the body. So outside a cell, not body orthodox cell. So therefore, as such, our success rates for antivirals is slow.
1655541454.0-1655573280.0
It took us so many years to get anti HIV drugs until date. Like I just said, Dengue doesn't have an antiviral chicken, connie doesn't have an antiviral chicken pork sand, we don't have antivirals so many as such as historically we have not done adequate research. Also we don't have good animal models to test those viral diseases. So I think we can certainly I'm sure globally there is now a lot of attention on viral disease already happening now. So maybe a few years from now we'll be in a better situation.
1655573890.0-1655606342.0
Well, one question which often gets asked to me, and I need to ask you also, especially with SARS, CoV two and COVID-19 or the novel coronavirus, usually the drugs precede the vaccine here. Smart scientists from your group and others. And you are very actively involved in the vaccine research in your earlier avatar at the Department of Biotechnology and BIRAC. How did we get a vaccine? And we are still struggling for a drug.
1655606486.0-1655611980.0
I took the vaccine. I'm sure you have taken the vaccine for vaccine. Yes.
1655615390.0-1655621680.0
If it's okay, let me spend a minute or so trying to answer this question. So one is yes.
1655624610.0-1655678106.0
One thing which happened differently is this time the developed countries were involved. The amount of funds and the amount of risk which those countries took really set the stage. The second thing which helped us weller was decades of research which had gone behind the mRNA technology platform. So that is what was immediately exploited for this disease and it firstly allowed a new platform to come in which was not coming early until it was time to stay in the oncology field thinking it was fearful for decades of research. The early action taken by the international global health we've seen the billions and trillions of dollars, maybe much more than drugvent here and we also knew that the diseases is highly transmission.
1655678298.0-1655698002.0
That understanding came very early in the disease process. So drugs will not be the best bullet because you need to stop transmission. And when any disease stays for so long, it means the role of vaccine is much higher. We are infected for so many days. So that understanding of science, I think really helped post vaccine.
1655698146.0-1655724014.0
And one thing which really helped once the globe came together, the number of partnerships. See, India saw so many vaccine development partnerships. Kobe Shield, which was given to 80, 85% people came through. A partnership with the west, with UK Covaxin came out because the wonderful experience Bharat Biotech had gained developing rotavirus. Actually, if you speak to Dr.
1655724052.0-1655753906.0
Krishna Allah, I'll tell you that this DSL Three was meant for some facility which is required, was meant for some other product he was making God utilized. So these are some of the reasons we were luckier with the vaccines. No, certainly we have been very lucky. We are very close to achieving 2 billion doses of the vaccine being given to Indians. An amazing feat, I must say.
1655754028.0-1655794270.0
Researchers, the physicians, the government, the health workers, all front line workers helped India battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, as we are coming close to the end of the discussion, I must also ask you, when you're not chasing bugs, you love chasing and driving fast with cars, what is your passion about driving in cars? And I believe you took a road trip all the way. A 50 day road trip from London to India. India to London.
1655794350.0-1655807722.0
India to London. Wow. Thank you, Paulo. That's a passion. Many people are not able to relate to that passion because I think what I love about that palove is my nomadic life.
1655807856.0-1655825486.0
It's a nomadic lifestyle. You're not answerable to anybody. There are no calls and there is no baggage of family, friends. I usually do it with an unknown group of people whom you make friends with. So you understand so many new people, you understand what road trip allows you to do.
1655825508.0-1655849122.0
Palab is understand new cultures. It lets you see them with. Otherwise you normally fly into a country and you fly out. This really helps you sit on their roadsides sit, understand the culture of that country, understand the food, the very basic food they eat, meet people and the sort of love and affection you get. We talk about so much of politics, we talk so much when we are sitting in our own countries.
1655849186.0-1655875434.0
But when you go and meet every travel so many countries on road, the love for humankind is very similar. We have got similar values, similar traits, similar requirements out of life and it's very nice to connect to that. And you also gather immunity as you go along when you're driving because you're eating and having local water, is that correct? Very true. Enjoy the local cuisine.
1655875482.0-1655878270.0
They are amazing. Each one of them is so unique.
1655890210.0-1655922000.0
Very true. Ah, those are those wonderful days. But yes, so honest answer.
1655925970.0-1655945910.0
Health system or Ace surveillance maybe? Maybe hospitals, peripheral health centers constantly marry labs. Status discovery and vaccine discovery. I call it discovery.
1655991530.0-1656007606.0
We should take care of a little bit. We are called the pharmacy of the world for manufacturing. Yes, very rightly. So it is you know that aspirations should never go away. So the next aspiration is we go upstream, downstream.
1656007638.0-1656023600.0
Both are manufacturing logistic distribution, brand new drug, new class of drugs. That's the only area we may want to focus on still now. So that is where you come into the picture in a big way.
1656025650.0-1656027680.0
That's the reason I point out. I know.
1656032230.0-1656067390.0
Thanks a lot for finding time and speaking to us Dr. Kavita. Always delight to listen to somebody who's so passionate, not just about chasing microbes but also going cross country on cars and learning so much about different cultures. And I'm sure the audience has learned a lot. One, that monkey pox is not a current threat for India and hopefully the surveillance we have will keep monkey pox away for us.
1656067540.0-1656116498.0
And also the fact that during COVID-19 our vaccine industry and the vaccine manufacturing and delivery has done wonders. And in times to come, hopefully diseases like dengue, chicken gunia, laish, manias, Kalazar will all find controls. The surveillance system and I've seen it working over districts is immensely strong and very strengthened now and hopefully a lot of effort which is happening through Ayushma and Parath and through the initiative of the government would fructify to give better help for all Indians. Thanks a lot for speaking to us Dr. Kavita.
1656116614.0-1656122160.0
Always a delight and may you keep India healthy. Thank you.
1656125970.0-1656174366.0

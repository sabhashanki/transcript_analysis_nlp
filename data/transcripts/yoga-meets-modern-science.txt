Dr sachinse or Buddhi hasti bano or Bhaat kam koro bah achalaktaha Bhatkarke so this was the conversation we had on where yoga meets modern science. This was part of towards a new India. A new India where yoga and yoga asans and pranayam will probably play a big role in keeping not only Indians calm but the world also calm. The world needs a lot of peace and prosperity and towards that, this discussion I'm sure will go a long way in giving peace of mind for many people since yoga and modern science are being married in Haritwar, one of the finest religious places in India. And this platform, Hulk, which offers an opportunity for an Indian social media platform to engage, is important for everybody to join on because this is a made in India platform for the world.

Today we are here to talk about their play Anandovari, which is an adaptation of a 1974 Marathi novel by Devi Mokashi. And Girish himself has adapted it in the form of a play. So welcome, all of you. It's great to have you here. And, you know, some of the notes you've sent me about the play are really fascinating.
1653955738.0-1653971358.0
And, you know, just to give people who listening in an idea about it, why don't you start with telling us what this play is about? Ghirius all right. Thank you. Prachi, great to be here. Can you hear me clearly?
1653971474.0-1653976060.0
Yes, absolutely. All right. Hi, Risha. Varad. Great to have everybody here.
1653977470.0-1653990810.0
So what's the play about? So there is the novel, and there is what we have done to the novel. Right. The novel essentially is about Tukaram's life. He has gone missing.
1653990970.0-1654016934.0
His younger brother, Kanha is searching for Tukaram. And as he's searching, he is recalling the story and life and inspiration. And he's questioning his brother in the process, trying to make sense of who his brother was. He was a brother, he was a householder, he was a businessman. And at one point in time, he was this great devotee, a great poet, and how these different identities then started colliding with each other.
1654016972.0-1654039870.0
And then eventually he worked towards transcending all of them in the process really giving voice to a lot of voices. At that moment, the voices that were being subjugated did not have access to divinity and all of that. So that is a novel. And what we have done is we've kind of intervened in the novel and we've created another. We've kind of taken the idea of the search.
1654039940.0-1654067158.0
And the search is like the common strand through and through our 70 minutes adaptation, where you have Kanha, who is searching for Tukaram. Then we've brought in Tokaram into the story, and he is searching for his with her. So there is a conversation that's happening between him. And we've also gotten the writer to step into the story as he's writing. So he is searching for Tukaram, the poet Tukaram, and trying to make sense of the creative process.
1654067324.0-1654085360.0
So there are these kinds of kinds of search that are kind of stringing the whole piece together, and we are jumping from one to the other, and we try to kind of tie it on at different points. Right. So it's essentially three narratives, all involving a search that you bring together.
1654087490.0-1654119042.0
That's wonderful. When did you first read the novel, and how and when did you decide you were going to adapt this into play someday? So, actually, I stumbled upon the play version of this before I read the novel. The famous we've got quite a legacy to kind of take forward. It's been done only once in Marathi theater, that too, by the kind of veterans of the theater, like Kishore Kadam and Atul Pea.
1654119106.0-1654148546.0
So I came across that adaptation online and I happened to read that adaptation in English, then I kind of saw bits of it, the staging of it online. And I'm like, this piece really interests me. So this is something I kind of stumbled upon, I think, eight years or so ago or nine years ago. And I was like, I want to do this at some point in time. And then it was only like, I think two years ago or three years ago that I finally kind of mustered the courage and I said, let's do something with it.
1654148728.0-1654175882.0
And then I discovered this. I discovered the novel. But I started reading the novel with a friend of mine who is an avid reader of Marathi literature and a theatre practitioner himself, of Shashimpi. And then I read it with him and kind of got in a deeper sense of the context, the writer. Then I started writing and scribbling some scenes in English and then said, okay, maybe something can happen here.
1654175936.0-1654192602.0
Maybe we can take this bit we can take and then I can bring in this bit. So that's how it all happened. And then finally there was a rehearsal process before. Varad and Rishab are a new addition to the ensemble. We opened it in Marathi two years ago with two different actors.
1654192746.0-1654215058.0
And those two actors were involved also in kind of helping me structure the text and put the text also together. So some of it also came together in the rehearsal space with the actors. Right. So this version that you have performed, I remember last month and you are performing now is an English version, no. So we are doing it in Hindi.
1654215154.0-1654239360.0
We're doing it in Hindi. Okay. We opened in Marathi, but we realized that just to widen the accessibility of it, to reach out to the audiences who I have usually reached out to Hindi. So we have it in Hindi. There are the abhangs of Sukharam that we bring in the clay, which are we kept it in Marathi itself because how do you translate those?
1654240210.0-1654249570.0
But we are commenting on it, we are referring to it. And that makes the audience make sense of those. Amongst.
1654252630.0-1654280010.0
This is a translation of the Marathi staging that you did. Or this was a whole other process of development. So the excerpts from the novel have been translated into Hindi by a translator, colleague, Dr. Jayadayal. And then my scenes were written in English, which were translated into Marati by Yoganda deshbandi, who's a writer of playwright himself.
1654280430.0-1654296240.0
And then those were also translated into Hindi. So this is a translation of the Marati of the novel and translation of my scenes in English, which were translated into Marathi. And then into him. Then into him. Okay.
1654297090.0-1654319240.0
That's a long process for this to actually come on stage in the current form. So when did you get involved, Rishab and Varath? When did you come on board? And I want to know, how did you first react to working on a play with a legacy like this and with the process of translation involved. Yeah.
1654323310.0-1654331180.0
I can't hear you very clearly. Varal. No. Yeah, that's better. Your mic clothes are better.
1654332590.0-1654370642.0
So I got involved last year when we were trying to restart the shows in Marathi because they lock down and all. So was planning to get me involved as Ghana and the other character was Mokashi and that was played by Suhas. And me and Suhas were going to take it forward. But we started the rehearsal, we started rehearsing it online through video calls and stuff. Then we met then we met in person in Mumbai and then we started rehearsing.
1654370706.0-1654404420.0
But the second phase of lockdown started and we couldn't do the shows. So everything got canceled again. And now this year when we were planning to restart the shows in Hindi, then I stepped in and I started rehearsing again in Hindi. I had rehearsed in Marathi before, but then I started rehearsing in Hindi and then Risk up came in. This time we were able to do the shows.
1654406550.0-1654412200.0
So you've been in both the Marathi and Hindi versions of that. I do a show.
1654415370.0-1654439770.0
And you've come in in the Hindi version of the play. The show, yeah. So officially as an actor, I came in for the Hindi version of the play. But technically I was also part of the Marathi shows also. And I was backstage and I made way less of the plot.
1654442030.0-1654479420.0
So even if it is Marathi, it is a very difficult Marathi. It was like I got some of my Marathi friends to watch it and for him also, it was very new and very fresh and something that they have not been watching very recently. That's why it was very intriguing for me in terms of the movement, in terms of the images, in terms of the physical score, it was very moving. Both the actors were phenomenal, mandar and Ajinkya and they were playing. And when they play, you see it play and you forget the language and you just see the magic of the play.
1654480430.0-1654514840.0
And I was working backstage, I was like kind of learning from them and also just the process wise. So I was part of it two years ago also. But then I knew that when if it is going to be in Marathi, I definitely can't get in because we also somewhere tried to read the Marathi bit of it. But for me I could read it but it was very difficult for me to obviously take it in and play. So then later also Karish decided let's just go with the Hindi one right now.
1654516410.0-1654534202.0
And Garish knew that I have somewhere known this play. And Garish also worked together in my DSM training. He was my faculty and all that. So somewhere we knew each other a bit. So that to trust each other for this play.
1654534256.0-1654591930.0
And he just got me on board and we decided, let's go with the Hindi one and yeah, Hindi one with the reading and just with the play. That bit was again interesting for me because I had watched this play in Marathi and also the physical score being the same and also most of the bits being the same, but the freshness was the language and to do it for the first time in Hindi and I am majorally a Hindi actor and it was very interesting for me and the text and the physical bit and to marry both together it was very interesting. So that's how I came in and we started playing wonderful. You all, in some sense, come in at different stages in the background but come in as actors later. So before I get into the other parts, I'd also like each of you to give us a little bit of an introduction.
1654592010.0-1654602740.0
I mean, I know Rishab has been an actor for a long time and Garish, you've been directing. So if you could start and give us a little background about your work in theater all this way.
1654605350.0-1654628978.0
So, Garish, you can start, I think. Yeah. So I've been doing theater in varied capacities that's it since 15 years now in Bombay. I started off as an actor with working title whichever part had working with him as an actor. Then I went into the field of theater education, you know, sort of using theatre as a tool, you know, to work with work with school and college students, sort of.
1654629004.0-1654665494.0
And that's when I also discovered the directorial, the storytelling in the right early part of me. And then in 2015 is when I opened my theater company called the Blind and the Elephant Theater Group where we did the first production called Ripples, which was an education kind of marrying my two passions on theater and education. Then I did another play called In Search of Darius Saga which is about Cindy identity, you know, trying to make sense of that. And now it was Anand Obery. So that's been one part of my theater company running, creating, writing, directing, adapting, producing one part of that.
1654665612.0-1654687580.0
The other part of theater journey goes in teaching. So I teach at the DSM as a faculty in devising theater and performance. I work in different capacities for their mentoring, being an audition panelist whenever and then also as a corporate coach. So essentially, theater is what is the basis of all that I do underlying okay. Yeah.
1654688990.0-1654694160.0
And various why don't you give us a little background as well?
1654697490.0-1654701600.0
Your voice is a little faint again. Yeah, better.
1654703730.0-1654708690.0
I'm a part of experimental and commercial theater circuit in Pune.
1654710790.0-1654733130.0
I have been a part of Nata Company. Nata Company is a group in Pune which is active for about twelve years. But I joined Natal Company three to four years back and I've been performing in Mahanirwan which is a play by Satisher. And we've done over 40 shows of Mahanir in various festivals.
1654736430.0-1654740970.0
Mostly that. And now I'm doing Anandovi.
1654744130.0-1654766066.0
I have followed your work a little bit, but do tell her. Yes, Patrick. Thank you. So I started doing full time not full time, but like professional theater since I was in college already. And when I was doing my media and communication studies in Manipul and there we had limited groups.
1654766258.0-1654791914.0
We were three groups together. And we used to put up shows and you also get those shows to Bangalore and Mumbai. So we were doing shows with the name of a theater group called Beethal. And we then took it back to it started in Udupi, Manipal, and then we took it to Bombay. And then we also did some shows here in Bombay.
1654792042.0-1654816710.0
But also, one of the reasons for me to come to Bombay was I had applied for this job at the Sport QTP is an arts management company. You talked to Kosar in one of the round table. Yes. So Kosar got me to Bombay and it was his house where I first lived for 1015 days to house and for my place to be in Bombay.
1654818810.0-1654852402.0
QTP was my first year in Bombay and managing Tesco and making networks meeting also, just in short, getting the understanding of the Bombay theater scene. And right after that year, I started getting some work. I started freelancing as a theatre artist, theater actors, and then somehow got to work with theater groups like Deeper Drama theater groups like atul Kumar, the Company Theater and all that. So majorly. And then COVID happened.
1654852456.0-1654877542.0
And then in Kobe days, I got to do my drama through Mumbai training. And that's where I got to work with Greece also. And yeah, so after that, then this was the first play I was a full length play I was part of right after my training. And this is very interesting for me. Once you get everything in your body with the training and all that and how to put it to use and how to just see how it applies.
1654877686.0-1654894430.0
So that's how it's also becoming to be a very important play for me. Thanks for that. And yeah, it's very interesting that invariably in all of our roundtables, the previous one gets referenced. Theatre is a really small word, you realize.
1654897250.0-1654920200.0
Yeah. So I want to come back to you, Ghirish, and I want you to tell me what the process of adapting the play was. And how did you work with that? Kind of didn't you at some point find it intimidating that you were adapting something that's such a seminal work and that has a legacy of performance on its own?
1654924970.0-1654945790.0
Intimidating? Honestly, not really, because for one of the reasons, because this play was done like, I think, about 20 years ago. So I think in terms of and also it was done in the world. You know Marathi theater, right? I don't particularly hail from that background.
1654946610.0-1654965974.0
I have very little connection with that world. In that sense, for me, there was no baggage or there was no context in that world to be intimidated by. I was hoping that maybe one day the makers of that play will come and watch our show. I hope they do this this weekend. It would be great to know what they think about it.
1654966172.0-1654996446.0
So there is that second interestingly also, this novel is one of the most important works of Marathi literature. I am not sure, and I may be wrong, but my initial conversations with one or two friends kind of revealed. Perhaps not many people are as aware of this work as they should be. So that's one, how was the process of adapting it? The good thing was that initially I had read it in English, right?
1654996468.0-1655031322.0
So there was a reference point for me. But then I read it in Marathi with my friend and then reading that once or twice again was very interesting because I could identify many of the excerpts and bits that were very, very important that could be brought into it. But I knew I didn't want to do it just the way it was written exactly. Because for me, what drew me to it was not just Tukarams, of course, Tuka's life and story. But it began with the question, what am I seeking in this way?
1655031376.0-1655058082.0
Why does this speak to me? And realized, in addition to his larger quest, spiritual quest and quest for social justice, the question of creative consciousness of the poet is something that really fascinated me. And so I wanted to play with that element. And that kind of got me really writing certain scenes in no particular order. I was also not sure how all of this is going to come together, if they will.
1655058216.0-1655090574.0
It was very writing in bits and sections and chunks. And that's how what I really enjoy about devising as a process, you eventually will find a way to make sense of it together and then you will have other voices who will come and help you clarify that. But yes, the first process was going back to the novel, reading it again, reading it with again a friend, Akshay Shimpi. Conversations with him were very helpful and sort of finding ways in where I could intervene. And that's how it was.
1655090612.0-1655120034.0
And then, of course, one last thing. Rehearsal space also was a very important place, as I've already pointed out, in the process of also clarifying what is it that I'm trying to do with this text. So other actors, other bodies coming in, other voices coming in. I remember the initial days was just we had a Marathi translation by Wonderful Yugandhar, who's a playwright in his own right. And we were just trying to then work with the translation.
1655120082.0-1655155620.0
So there was also bit of writing that the actors did just playing with each other to tap into the original voice. So that structure, in a way, was found in the rehearsal space. So there was that as a very important process of the adaptation, I would say. So from it being a very solitary journey to it becoming a conversation with a friend who was sort of who also read these different pits, then to going into a rehearsal space with a bit of a jumbled piece and then with the actors and their bodies trying to make sense of it. And then once we found it, we found it.
1655157990.0-1655193520.0
How long did the process take? Until maybe your first draft in this case. So I remember we definitely rehearsed for about it began it all began on a rainy day in the month of August 2019, mid August 2019. And I remember we I think we found the place somewhere in November or December, and we had an audience who came in and saw an initial version and helped us identify what's working, what's not working. And then we kind of yeah.
1655194050.0-1655220258.0
So I'd say two to three months. We did two previews of it for Intimate Audience, and then January we opened, and then thereafter, it was more about just cutting it down to size because it's novel, so there's a storytelling to it. It can get quite verbal. And the original Marathi is wonderful, but it's literary in nature. So another part of the translation was to kind of have some sound and texture of the Marati.
1655220274.0-1655242378.0
And because Varadi is himself a Marathi actor, so he brings that in really beautifully. And to make it also easy on the year and make it more spoken right. Perfect. So what was the process for the two of you coming into a play like this? And it being devised work with the involvement of actors.
1655242474.0-1655246880.0
So what has your experience been, both Varad and Rishabas? You could tell me.
1655251890.0-1655258080.0
Can you hear me? A little faint again, I think. Yeah.
1655261050.0-1655262920.0
Yeah, that's better, I think.
1655266730.0-1655274060.0
Can you proceed? I can't hear whether that also no. I heard him in between. Check. Hello?
1655276350.0-1655284060.0
No, it's still faint. It's there, but it's faint. You want to try? I'll change my earphones. Okay.
1655287230.0-1655290640.0
Can we hear from British in the meanwhile, then? Yeah.
1655293170.0-1655311720.0
So right after the training, gheesh was in touch with me with this script. And we were regularly talking about to do this in Marathi or in Hindi. And also somewhere, again, as I told Ki, we tried to do it.
1655314010.0-1655354542.0
He was more inclined towards getting an actor who will do it in Marathi and Hindi both because it is a Marathi play. And then Hindi is just an option that we are exploring and where we need to get to the Indian audience also. That was one of the first challenge for me to get into that Marathi space, even if it is in Hindi. There are a bungs in Marati and the whole story and everything is so Marathi and so the culture. And we do have parallels.
1655354606.0-1655388862.0
We do have similar kind of stories in our I come from Bihar. We have our own stories, we have our own folk stories. But somewhere to also get into that shoe where you play characters like Tukaram, first you need to know Tukaram and first you need to know the sanctity of that person. And things like people say that the literature of Marathi began from Gyanoba and it ended with Tukaram. And nobody could ever write anything like that after him.
1655388996.0-1655437840.0
So things like that and all that, just to get used to that and just to embody it was something very challenging for me. And somewhere I knew that I can bring that and the rasa of that I know that those rasas but I don't know those stories. And to bring it all together, it will be difficult for me. And it was where I was working on this script but I also had to somewhere read around the script, somewhere had to listen to again. I met Akshaya Shimpy and he opened it up for me again and he told me what Tuka is, how Kanha really was looking for him.
1655438930.0-1655478698.0
And even Kanha wrote some of the abangs and the relationship of Duka and Wittal, all that and it's not very bhakti and it's not very regular relationship. It's beyond all that. It's beyond anything and you can't comprehend what is it. And that's also one of the search for me to keep. It not very regular but the way but then I believe when you come with the body it all starts making sense.
1655478784.0-1655497242.0
And I just threw myself in and somewhere it started making sense inside and somewhere it all came together. So it was very beautiful where I started with my body and then started thinking what is happening? What is happening? And not thinking and then going. Did it also involve a lot of reading?
1655497306.0-1655533770.0
And did you make an attempt to learn the language to sort of get into that space? As you said, even though it is now in Hindi, it still belongs in that world and it comes with that. Weight of Marathi literature and the greatest medium is Hindi. So did you make an attempt to learn the language or was there a lot of reading involved? So I was very absorbing to the whole language.
1655534210.0-1655565080.0
Whatever I listened to, I was like okay, this is the thing I learned today. And even some of the lines that's there in the script. But majorly language and pronunciation wise, where the difficulty lies majorly. I had to go back to Viras regularly and he told me how to just prepare my Lord to learn and all that.
1655571790.0-1655593658.0
Obviously both the scripts are they nagri but simple, simple things gets very Pune. We did shows in Pune and Pune people will get to know if you are not actually speaking those words correctly. So all that was there. But I had to reach out to Akshaya. I had to reach out to Mandara.
1655593674.0-1655628342.0
I had to take help from Varad and yeah, they supported, they were there. And somewhere I also had to believe that okay, I can speak it because Hindi, Marathi and even somewhere I come from teaching where I was made to learn many Sanskrit Shlokas and Sanskrit Slocas. And these Abangs doesn't sound very different. Somewhere they are in the same space. So I believe that I can speak these avenues with the same amount of weight.
1655628406.0-1655643934.0
And so all that somewhere took place and happened. Right. What about you, Varat? I hope you're not having trouble with the connection. Yeah, I think the problem is solved now.
1655644052.0-1655652846.0
Yes. You are actually great. Yeah. Okay, I got the question. Yeah.
1655652948.0-1655666674.0
So what do I want to understand? Rishab just told us about the process that was involved for him to get into a play like this. So what was it for you? Because you come from a completely different space. You are a Marathi actor.
1655666802.0-1655694074.0
His struggle was the language. So what was it like for you? Yeah, for me, basically I am from a Marathi medium school. So many of Tukaram's Abbhans and a lot of Abba's or a lot of poetry from the that many of the saints in Marathi had written. We had it in our celabics.
1655694202.0-1655721514.0
So I had learned a lot of this kind of poetry in my celeb in my school days. So that was not really difficult for me. The difficult part was this physicality involved in the play. I am basically very comfortable with text, but the physical part was a little difficult for me and I had to practice a lot for that. But was there and risk was there.
1655721552.0-1655724220.0
So they made it very easy for me. Right.
1655727150.0-1655739600.0
I was also familiar with the. I. Learned the text in Marathi first. So it was not that difficult for me to learn it in Hindi. Right.
1655740850.0-1655741600.0
Yeah.
1655743970.0-1655768822.0
The two of you have very different entry points and it would be very interesting to see this sort of confluence come together on stage. So, Garish, I want to go back to you about this. You've told us about the legacy of the play, the process. I want to understand from you, how does this hold up in a contemporary setting today? Why would an audience watch it?
1655768956.0-1655771740.0
How do you relate to it and how will they relate it to?
1655774110.0-1655798514.0
Yeah, that's a great question. Prachi, the starting point for any creative project is because it speaks to some part of you, right? Yes. So for me, coming across a story of the Karam, something that I really haven't been exposed to, I've grown up in Bombay, I've grown up in surroundings that have been Maharashtran. It's something that always is around.
1655798712.0-1655849220.0
But I haven't had the opportunity to sort of delve into the life and the works and the influences and the inspirations and the modernity of people like this. Some people say that the idea of modernity began in medieval times for us with the whole idea of the Bhakti movement. So for me, just coming across that itself and what I was speaking seeking spiritually in my life at that moment answers to some of these questions, it spoke to me for me also. One other thing is Kanha as a character is very interesting because he is the window for us into the world of the world also of that time in some senses, right into the events that were happening at that point in time. And the novel kind of goes into it with great depth and detail.
1655849670.0-1655908980.0
But Kana is almost, for me, very represent. I could resonate with that voice that was asking questions of Takara, that was doubting some of the choices Tukara made that was even pointing to some very interesting, at times even calling his brother extremely veined by saying, every time you say Tuka money or says Tuka, isn't that also kind of vanity? Isn't that what you want to go beyond? So I found that voice is an interesting window, and I thought that could be a great that's the novel for me. The other thing, of course, was how to so I think this whole artistic quest, this whole thing of what shapes the psyche of somebody who's writing, what influences, where do those words come from?
1655912150.0-1655962310.0
So for me, also, that question was very fascinating, and I thought it's a universal question also. So this play is like it's asking some of those existential questions that shaped Tukara, and it is simultaneously trying to show a writer's journey to grapple with what made Tukaram who he was. So for me, that kind of makes it, in some senses, universal, and that also makes it relevant in that sense. It's asking those sort of bigger questions, I think, of what makes who creates home? Does God create the devotee, or does the devotee give identity to God?
1655962460.0-1655975960.0
Does the writer find the character, or does the character find the writer? So forget that is at the heart of the investigation of a play who creates who? And I think it's an eternal philosophical question.
1655978810.0-1656004014.0
And the kind of the meridian of the narratives, the form of the piece, those kinds of questions, I think, make it extremely, I feel, make it very contemporary. Okay. So, yeah, that's another thing I want to delve into. When talking about form, like, Juanita is also talking about the kind of physical training he has to go through. So what can you tell us about the form of this claim?
1656004062.0-1656027050.0
What can you tell us about the process of devising something like this? It is a departure from the text in some sense. So how did you work on the physicality of this? Raji it comes from what interests me. I mean, I'm really interested in sort of the visual.
1656027710.0-1656055620.0
There is the visual storytelling. It's the kind of compositions. There's also the idea of creating. Interesting spaces. So, for me, I was very clear that I wanted to find a very physical, visual compositional, essentially wanted to tell a story as much visually, spatially and compositionally as I wanted to tell it towards.
1656056630.0-1656086198.0
I was very clear that right from the start that it will be two people who will be creating multiple characters. I was also interested in saying that, how can we move from the real to the surreal visually and physically? How can we navigate these different worlds? So I essentially wanted to create these different kinds of worlds, you know, that the story goes into. There is that surreal world of the writer.
1656086294.0-1656120726.0
There is that even more transcendental moment and yet so intimate between Tokaram and Vithel. And there is that search of the brother, which kind of strings the whole piece together. So I wanted to create these different spaces, these different kind of compositions, and they kind of melded to each other, just like the narratives go from one to the other. So I wanted to tell the story. I think it's always nice to kind of also bring up quotes at this moment, those quotes that those things that some people have said that kind of govern some part of you.
1656120748.0-1656154654.0
It's like how Peter Brooks said that. How do you make the invisible visible? And as a director, for me, that's what I was seeking to do. How do we make the invisible, the search, whatever it is in the text, how do we bring that physically and visually and in terms of the design, even the composite set wise, even the lights, everything, how do we build this world that has got many other worlds within it? And this is something I had to find with the actors.
1656154702.0-1656169106.0
So this was some of the ideas I had. The actors were aware of it, and some of them had also worked with me in different capacities earlier. So they were aware of what I'm going for. And then they kind of found it. They improvised.
1656169298.0-1656204340.0
They found it. So it was at times, me just offering provocations, and then the actors could take off Mandarin ajinkya. And then it was more about chipping stripping, giving it form, giving shape, bringing some of those elements back. So, I mean, did you rely on any traditional forms or this is largely improvisational, and it doesn't stick to some kind of form. There's no traditional form that has influenced, but there's a lot more I don't know.
1656205270.0-1656236302.0
Devising is not just a process. At times, it can be a form in itself, which is very ensemble driven, very physical, very visual. So I think those were some of the that is what we were trying to find. So you have also performed this play early, and you're doing a few shows again. So I want to know what the response has been and an extension from my earlier question.
1656236436.0-1656276010.0
How is the audience relating to this claim? What do they have to say. And what have you heard so far? It's been interesting because we opened it in Marathi initially I think there was a sense of people were really I would say they were really fascinated by the form and by the storytelling that we were going for. At times I think for us the journey was to sort of work with the verbosity and the pace and the rhythm of the storytelling.
1656277390.0-1656314882.0
But I think it was very interesting because for people who come from when we perform a Marathi audiences they were really aware of the milieu and the world of Thukara and everything. So they were very interested in how we were retelling that story for the modern times and reinventing it in that sense. So they were really fascinated by the search and the questions. And the questions with the Hindi audience has been really wonderful because a lot of them don't come with that kind of context and background. So for them it's been for me very heartening to know that a lot of them are getting interested in sort of knowing more about the Karam.
1656315026.0-1656338334.0
So the story there is a loads happening in the play. But the heart of it is the story of a brother who's searching for his brother, who's pining for his brother. A brother who was to him the world and a brother perhaps whose greatness he couldn't ever make sense of. So that's been wonderful that people have. Been I would like to add one point.
1656338452.0-1656369558.0
Yes. Sorry for interrupting. No problem. Being a Marathi actor, it was a little difficult for me to explain my friends, that you should come watch a play in which we are in which the main characters is criticizing tupparam so great Tent, the great poet, the great Victul Bhat main character is criticizing. It was a little tough for me to get those people to come to the theater and watch the play.
1656369644.0-1656403490.0
But as the people who came and actually watched the play, they were really enlightened and they were happy that we got to watch something which was not explored before by the Marathi playwrights except for Ananduhi. But even that, even when Ananuary was performed before, it was not like this. I have not seen it. But Garry has adapted it very differently. As he likely pointed out.
1656403640.0-1656426860.0
He actually told you that there are three parallel threads, three parallel searches going on. In the actual novel there is only one search going on, which is the physical search that Kana is looking for his elder. But in the Nata in the play there are three actually three different parallel searches going on. So this was a little different. These type of plays don't happen in.
1656429790.0-1656445118.0
It'S. Very interesting. Just to kind of add to that, there is Kanoba in the novelist definitely constantly referring to Karam search. So the word showed like what were you searching for? Is something that keeps coming up.
1656445204.0-1656467800.0
So there is a resonance of that that search is not shown in that sense. You're just picking up those trends and really trying to explore the vulnerability and the humanity of Tukara. I mean, just trying to assess him holistically all the complex threads at work.
1656471930.0-1656494750.0
That's quite interesting, what Varad said, that you're questioning a great you are in some way criticizing. So did you get some kind of criticism as well from Marathi theater goes who have been reading and watching Marathi plays for a long time. Was there hesitant? Was there criticism?
1656497670.0-1656529210.0
I think there's a lot of tenderness and there's a lot of innocence and there's a lot of intimacy and gentleness in the way Kanoba is trying to make sense of his brother. So it's not like it's not a critique in that sense. It's just an investigation of a brother who's just reminiscing his brother while searching for him and longing for him. So there's that quality to it. And that quality is what makes it makes Tukaram even more accessible.
1656530350.0-1656553794.0
So I think because of that and that is the tone and tenor of the novel, which is really beautiful in that sense. It's what I think makes people really respond to it equally gently. It's not that we are putting to Garam in the dock. It's nothing like that. And it's not coming from the outside.
1656553912.0-1656570034.0
It is, like you mentioned, coming from a very brotherly. Exactly. And a brother who is as close. To him, his own brother, is trying to understand what his brother is trying to say. So ultimately he realizes Ukraine's poetry.
1656570082.0-1656583500.0
He he actually understands what Tuka is trying to say through his poetry. So first he's decising in a very brotherly manner, but ultimately he realizes what he's trying to explain.
1656587090.0-1656598900.0
It spans the time in his life when this time he disappears and doesn't come back. Right. It's the last three days. So there's a certain urgency to the search.
1656601430.0-1656609510.0
There's an urgency to the search. There's an urgency to the storytelling. There is desperate longing battling with desperate despair.
1656612090.0-1656621990.0
And in that process of storytelling, we visit the spaces that they visited, we visit the life, we visit some of. The important events criticizing the god himself.
1656625790.0-1656656770.0
It sounds all very poetic, even at this level when we are talking about it. So I want to sort of turn it around to all of you and tell me what were the parts like? I think Varad explained this part where he heard a little bit of criticism of this kind. I want you to go and tell me what parts of the play personally appeal to you most. If there is a particular part of the play, if there is a particular line that resonated with you personally.
1656659130.0-1656680810.0
I. Think I'd like to start with the actors here and then come back to you, Garish, So, Varad, Rishab, whoever. Yeah. Okay. The thought that fascinates me is there's a scene in the play in which kana is the second day of the search and Kana is looking for Tukahi.
1656681310.0-1656693310.0
And he stumbles upon a person in the village who is mentally challenged. Jania. His name is Jania. And Jania.
1656695330.0-1656717910.0
Parallel. Kana is also talking to Tuka that how can this guy, this Jania, be so happy? Even if he's mentally challenged, even if he's free from all the free from all the restrictions, he's free from everything. That is the reason he is happy. And that is the kind of bliss I am looking for.
1656717980.0-1656752830.0
This is what Tuka says to Kanha. So I think that thought really fascinates me. That this is the point. This point is really difficult to understand, as in our practical world, but through the NATO, through the play, we are trying to understand that thought, the ultimate bliss, what is ultimate belief that Tuka is trying to find, that is being free from everything. Being free from everything worldly, even his god being free from his Victal.
1656753650.0-1656795102.0
So Jania doesn't even need Victal to survive. Jana needs nothing. So that is the thought which fascinates me the most. And as I said, that all of these abangs were had learned all these abundance in the syllabus, but these deep thoughts which were not there in the syllabus, we were just trying to learn the abundance and we're trying to understand the meaning of it, just trying to understand the dictionary meaning of the word and write those meanings in the exam. But these are the deep thoughts that I learned, that I learned in the process of the play.
1656795236.0-1656799280.0
And that was very enlightening for me.
1656801670.0-1656841146.0
Thanks for that FARA. I think that's quite intriguing and makes me want to come and listen to how this plays out on stage. Risha, what about you? What part of the case resonated with you? Yeah, I really like the fact what this play is that even in spite of this being very even in the very divine and very poetic space, equally, it is very household and very just one brother looking for another, basically looking for another brother who's gone missing.
1656841338.0-1656864758.0
And then in that search, he's just talking about how you used to be when you were there and how I used to talk to you. And then when someone just go missing. And then we start remembering everything we had with the memories we had with them. And finally we realize how important they were when they're not there. Just this human aspect of this story.
1656864844.0-1656900110.0
And forget his bhagti towards Witthal, forget his all literature and forget everything. Just this brother looking for his elder brother who was so loving to him when he was a child. They grew up together, they played together and they used to go to this nadi and they used to play together. And all those memories, which makes it a lot more household and where you will relate to somebody. I go and I know that I am an elder brother to one of my younger brothers.
1656900950.0-1656927418.0
I know what it is and we never talk about it. We never know how important they are. And just that moment when he is telling him he's talking to his elder brother who's gone missing now he's saying, you come back. I never let you be what you wanted to be, but you now come back and be yourself. Do whatever, write up, hungs, dance with people, do whatever, but just come back.
1656927584.0-1656947230.0
And that fact and just this longing, which is very human, not at all poetic. We all go through all that. We all live through that longing. So just this idea of display, just. The despair that's visible.
1656953090.0-1656961640.0
Lastly, Gary, coming back to you. I know it's difficult that somebody who adapted and directed the play, what was your favorite part and why?
1656966490.0-1656991120.0
It's a very difficult question. For me, it's gotten me really thinking. I think for me, as Bishop said, it's those little human moments that happen. There's loads happening in the play. There are many narratives, but essentially those little moments that happened between two people.
1656993090.0-1657039838.0
There's the writer, Kanha, sitting in his lap. He's telling a story and suddenly they're describing the drought that had happened. So there's this moment where Kanha looks at the sky and he starts its monsoons of finally, rain has come after a massive and there's this moment when Kanha can't hold himself back and the writer kind of joins him. And both of them are just for a moment, just enjoying the rain together. So complete identification of the writer with the character and the situation that is, I think I'd say there are another few, but I'd say that, for me.
1657039844.0-1657059620.0
Is one of the most memorable. Yeah, I look forward to when I'm watching the play because I think for me, it's also very good. How much can even the two actors give each other and take off and play off each other? Because you can't hold there. You can't hold.
1657059990.0-1657078038.0
Neither can you be enjoying that moment alone. As an actor, you have to really give each other a lot to be able to create that moment of what that train means to the character and to him. So for me, that on many levels, is very important. Right. That's wonderful.
1657078134.0-1657105886.0
And it's quite fitting that you will be playing this nearly when the first trains are here, quite close to that. You've given us a nice little glimpse into what this play will be. Now, if you can tell us when the shows are and where. So we'd also like to put it out there. So whoever wants to catch the play can I think that's a question in the audience also if there are any plans of bringing it to Bangalore.
1657105918.0-1657124382.0
So if you could tell us that as well. Yes, of course. We'd love to. Bangladesh has always been so appreciative and accepting of at least the work we've taken there and the kind of experiments we've done there. So it's always a joy performing for our Bank Lord audiences.
1657124466.0-1657144970.0
We really hope to come there. We're kind of putting in applications, so, yeah, soon. As of now, nothing planned, but I'm hoping the next two to three months. As for our shows, Prachi this Friday, which is the third in June, we are playing at 08:30 P.m. At Veda Factory in Warsova in anderi west.
1657145130.0-1657169270.0
The duration of the play is, you know, 65 to 70 minutes long, but Loads is happening in that 70 minutes. So it's a nice black box intimate space. Saturday we are playing at Sudarshan Ranmund in Shanimar, based in Pony. We play there at 07:00 P.m.. Again, one of the most older, important, nice experimental theaters in Pony.
1657169850.0-1657185340.0
And on Sunday we are at this very interesting black box experimental space in Mdabad. It's on the Ashuram Road. It is called Prayok Shala. We are doing two shows, one at 07:00 P.m. And the other one at 09:30 P.m..
1657187550.0-1657214454.0
And what's very exciting, just as an aside, after our four day and the art shows that we've just got an interval of half an hour to catch the train to the next city. Okay, so the drama doesn't end. Yeah, it's going to be a drama filled weekend for you, as I can see. And I really hope people can catch your show in all of these cities. And do keep us posted whenever you're performing next.
1657214492.0-1657221682.0
We'd love to, you know, put the word out. Thanks so much for joining me. Thanks, Kirish. Thanks, Barra. Then thanks, Rishab.
1657221826.0-1657229942.0
I hope you have wonderful tours then. Thank you, Brady, really, for having us, hosting us. This is wonderful. Thank you, Bradshi. Thank you.
1657229996.0-1657230420.0
Thanks so much.

So hello and welcome to another episode of India Inc on Kulk. Today's episode is a part of our Naya Dot series where we look at India's history in the last 75 years post its independence and also its part in the next 25 where India will reach its 100th year of independence. So on today's roundtable, we are going to be talking about one of the most significant economic reforms that took place in the last 75 years. And for that conversation we have with us today veteran journalist and author Sandeep Singh. Sandeep has been covering the sandeep has been covering Indian economy for several decades and has booked like the inside story of Indian banking under his name.
1659673968.0-1659677420.0
Hi, Sandy. Welcome to Kurti. Hello.
1659679550.0-1659682410.0
We are looking forward to a very interesting session.
1659685710.0-1659710546.0
We hope that it would make some time for us today. And before we move on to some questions, I like to give a small introduction to our viewers on our topic today and what we'll be discussing. So an Indian economy has moved through challenging times in the last 75 years. One of the most significant budgets in post independence India was Dr. Manmohan Singh's budget of July 1991 under the administration of PV.
1659710578.0-1659763160.0
Narasan Haraw. The economic policies of civilization, privatization and globalization that could undertaken following the budget helped open up the Indian economy to the world. The reforms aimed at relaxing restrictions around economic activities, abolishing the permit charge, reducing tariffs and other barriers, encouraging transfer of ownership from the public sector to the private sector and relaxing restrictions on imports and exports and easing the inflow of foreign capital into the Indian market. On today's roundtable, we are going to take a look at the economic situation from 1985 onwards that led to the trade and policy changes of 1991 and how these reforms have impacted the several decades that followed. Sandy, if you are ready we'll jump into some questions.
1659763690.0-1659802690.0
Yeah, sure. So before we start talking about the reforms of 1991, can you tell us a bit about what were the biggest economic milestones before the 1990s, notably during the during the Indra Gandhi's administration? See, when India became independent there were two major problems. We didn't have any industry and we did not have an agricultural system which gave us basic staple food for our population.
1659804890.0-1659856770.0
Though two third of the population lived of agriculture, we were dependent on what was called the USAID PL 480 for our basic needs. We didn't grow enough wheat, we didn't grow enough sugar and there was a shortage of a whole lot of items. Besides that, we had very little industries. There were some industries which were due to the Tatas and the Bilaters and there were some railway infrastructure but we didn't have anything which was really worthwhile calling industries. So these were the twin challenges when the British transferred power to India.
1659856930.0-1659915030.0
As a matter of fact, India's economy at that time was dependent on cash crops like the et cetera, which we used to sell to retail and then marble drills and other items which are valuables, which was going out from India and surprisingly even OPM India. 10% of TPP was on account of opium from Malware region and from Bengal region. The British used it to undermine the Chinese regime, china, the opium wars, all that. So that was about half 100 years. So India did not have a proper agricultural setup for itself and it did not have any industry.
1659916410.0-1659958070.0
Nahu was very intent on the fact that India should have its own industry. But Nahu was a socialist, he was formed in socialism, so he didn't believe in the private sector at all. What he did was he started public sector units to manufacture. Amongst them there are some which are still very profitable and very industries like petroleum.
1659962250.0-1660007160.0
There was DVC and there was a whole lot of them. So it was and they were about central Warehousing Corporation cement Corporation of India. Fertilizer Corporation of India. So all these units, the Nehru setting them up and there was one advantage over there which he had is we didn't want to set up all of them in the metro. What is this?
1660008650.0-1660056820.0
The industrial plan was to set it up in different areas. For example, there was something in Rao Kila, something in Bokaro, something in something in Bopal, all sorts of small towns, et cetera, which were unearthed. These public sector uses came up. This provided employment to a vast majority of the people and they also provided a lot of industrialization which took the first decade or something like that to just set it up. But it happened slower than steadily it happened.
1660058010.0-1660061320.0
One problem of Nehru was he did. Not.
1660063370.0-1660100610.0
At all believe in private sector growth. So that was one issue. But then because there was this industrialization which happened, there was something in the economy which was still missing. We were manufacturing goods but we were not good enough to sell it because there was no private sector. So the entire thing was a very slow moving socialist way of movement which was in Russia and in China.
1660102630.0-1660149714.0
Government itself sets up everything, government itself, everything. And government itself does not work actually. So the economy solely started drifting down. Now, the first problem happened that started at the end of his career. Derek started to have good ambitions of being a global leader leading the nonaligned movement and that is that politics and economics did not work together.
1660149912.0-1660173370.0
And as you know, the disaster 1962 war, you know, he missed quite a few tricks and with China, you know, took over a lot of patient immoralized the Indian mind. So 1962 war was a big setback.
1660179070.0-1660259640.0
There was virtually spill made for a few years after which narrow one died. After that was left to Lalma to revive the their agriculture did a lot of good things. The daring form he started with started amol so that was during that period and then the wind, which was going nowhere, that also was given a direct and unfortunately, Shasti lived only for three years. And after Shasti wenti, who basically barred in a few years, she ruled for around 18 years. There was a Janta period between and all these things.
1660260010.0-1660274940.0
During this time, the move to socialism was much more pronounced because what happened is that the US.
1660277310.0-1660320140.0
Did not support India in the Indopark War of 1965. Now, the Indopark War of 1965 was one in which Castry had won the war comprehensively, but as a result of which the grains stopped coming. We will stop supplying India the grains under TL 480 for around two years. And India did not have enough foreign exchange reserves. And India was in a tough place.
1660321070.0-1660344450.0
What India did is India started a rupee trade with Rafiya that was Indira Gandhi's master store. So at least there was a flow of essential commodities and arms and industrial machinery from Russia.
1660350550.0-1660423820.0
The entire dependence on Russian economy that we see today also including the arms, started from Indira Gandhi's time because the US, Pakistan and then came the 1971 war, which, you know, against one comprehensive. So each of these wars, you know, 62, 65, 71, they were all a burden on the economy in a very tough situation. That's easy to say that the progress was very slow, there was no rate of growth, did not have enough.
1660427150.0-1660452210.0
Because of this went into the Ruth with Russia and because we had to have arms, we again moved closer to Russia. And as we kept on moving closer to Russia, our option to open up and liberal started closing.
1660455190.0-1660460180.0
Then Indira Gandhi's Famous Bank nationalization happens.
1660462250.0-1660509110.0
Now, when the bank nationalization happened, the private sector banks were not delivering. So Indra Gandhi nationalized the bank and after which the banking sector really grew very fast. You have to give the credit where it is due and deserves a lot of credit for the banking sector. After both the capital input as well as the receivable and the banking sector became vibrant and people in remote areas could bank. That was one of the biggest advantages.
1660511450.0-1660519750.0
It was the highlight, just like public sector, it was the highlight of the Nehru.
1660526090.0-1660568406.0
But once banks national, then he nationalized the coal industry also. There are lots of problems in the coal industry and she died. After he nationalized the coal industry, the problems really started because she thought that was not doing well, should be nationalized. Nationalized the cement industry. It's CCI, then the industry sale, et cetera, textile industry, national Textile Fertilizer Corporation of India.
1660568518.0-1660637520.0
So every industry, private sector industry, which is not doing well, she nationalized and they started believing they were not performing at all. Now, another thing what she did is she started this restricting private sectors to ensure that the public sector blew. Private sector licensing policies were changed and the entire system was such that this entire what we call as the license permit Raj started. And in the license permit Raj, you will find that it's a very difficult situation then, because everything you had to have permission from the government to go ahead for every license, you couldn't even invest your own money.
1660639970.0-1660687390.0
And as a result of which, if you see Bajaj Kutas, that time has a 20 year vacation period if you have to go and buy this for 20 years just because Bajaj was not allowed to in their own plant and expand ten years. It was always like that with Indra Gandhi, always. She was putting more and more rules and regulations in the state to slow down the private sector.
1660689730.0-1660723990.0
Okay, slowing down the private sector is one thing. The public sector never picked up bureaucrats who were making money in the license permit Raj were making money permissions to the public sector also. Ultimately, it was a very huge corruption which started undermining the economy.
1660726490.0-1660770250.0
The economy started slipping due during his time, you can say it went to a crisis limit during interrupt. That was nearly two decades of. The. Her administration that pressure on the public sector was increasing and private sector literally kept shrinking into a point that led to 1991. So if I'm not wrong, the few years that led to 1991 specifically, I think you are mute.
1660773710.0-1660782000.0
Had two decades of Indira Gandhi's rule. It is around 35 years.
1660785410.0-1660814598.0
We had this issue of how to run a socialist government and how to have socialism in India. So 35 years, 1st 35 years was pure social. Yeah. So the crisis that led up to 1991 was sort of brewing for all these years. And it's not a result of this is I'm talking up till Indira Gandhi, which is 1984.
1660814764.0-1660818860.0
Okay? It became worse after that.
1660824430.0-1660869686.0
Now what Indira Gandhi did is he was able to restrict imports. Whatever imports were coming in that time was under the Rupee Ruble agreement. Most of the imports did not put pressure on the foreign expense. So Indra Nandi, although the union industry sector was down and private sector was not allowed to prosper and lots of things are there. One thing was there that there was no pressure of the dollar rupee Parity, because India had this thing.
1660869788.0-1660900850.0
So we were doing it somehow with Rakia. And Rakia was not in a very bad condition at that point of time, Rashia started much safer. So at that point of time, Rashia had enough disputes and India stayed with Rasheer basis. And therefore things did not come to a crisis, but things were desperately going from back to first. Yes.
1660900920.0-1660940030.0
And we saw the most we saw the worst part of this crisis in the few years before 1991 when it was leading up to almost to a default that thankfully did not happen then. So do you want to give us a bit of what happened right before now? What happened you see after Indira Gandhi indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984. So after that Rajiv Gandhi came. Now Rajiv Gandhi wanted to liberalize the economy.
1660940690.0-1660950690.0
Only problem is that he did not have any idea of how to reciprocity. So what he did he opened imports.
1660953850.0-1660994240.0
He had been educated abroad and he knew the advantages of computerization. Nobody wanted computerization at that time. But Rajan was held that yes, we must have know that without computerization we wouldn't have seen anything what we are today. But at that point of time computer was not a priority for the normal Indian. But Rajiv insisted that we must have computer and he brought in computers very important.
1660995650.0-1661015750.0
Then Sunday Randy had started a car project which is not now that car project was revitalized by bringing in Maruti Suzuki on the same land et cetera.
1661017930.0-1661030060.0
So Maruti Suzuki came in. So Maruti Suzuki was also very much needed collaborative positive things which they have done.
1661037010.0-1661072780.0
Suzuki is of course a success story, everybody knows it. But he liberalized imports if he understood that India will need gas at some point of time. So he brought in the HBJ pipeline under the kilometer gas pipeline from Hazida to Bija punpur Bija called the HBJ gas pipeline where the gas was piped from Gujarat to you.
1661076590.0-1661116790.0
Now in that project there was one gentleman who was representing Lambdogan whose name was Octovio Kataruchi. Now Kataruchi happened to be known to Sonia Gatri and he was instrumental in various deals. So Rajiv Gandhi found that he got into this where there were allegations of corruption.
1661119210.0-1661135290.0
He's made a big packet in 30. Then there were other helicopters deed where there was money and then there was this border.
1661137330.0-1661141600.0
So in all these three this Italian gentleman was important.
1661144610.0-1661146820.0
There were the Hindu Jas and others.
1661149590.0-1661166070.0
But the basic thing was that these people had spent money and had received back from the Italian. So that was the basic narrative.
1661168270.0-1661188830.0
And there was a lot of proof also of that journalist from Hindu and others. They went all over to Europe and they got those transcripts of money being non etc.
1661194390.0-1661198260.0
But ultimately what happens a lot of that.
1661205130.0-1661214600.0
After one term he had to demit office and he p sing took over.
1661217370.0-1661222810.0
Now VP Singh he also was a low VII socialist.
1661226750.0-1661267838.0
Rajasthani was probably not a socialist. Only thing that he wanted to liberalize the economy. He wanted imports to come in but he didn't know how to help the private sector step up domestic supply. So he liberalized imports but he didn't do enough for delicacing the Indian. As a result of this there was this foreign exchange crisis.
1661268034.0-1661300800.0
This foreign exchange prices were not although the economy was swimming down because she was dealing with. But the moment Rajiv Gandhi came and he started importing this foreign exchange started. As a matter of fact during Rajiv Gandhi's time the rupee plunged from eleven to $16.
1661303690.0-1661343330.0
And so this was the story of the four years of Raghu Band. Now, Mr. Singh was also a socialist and so was Chandrashikar who followed BP. Now these guys had no interest in liberalizing the economy. Singh was famous for his Mundel Commission report which was a social engineering so that the OBC category gets reservation in government jobs.
1661344150.0-1661379238.0
So it has got nothing to do with the economy. And People was a staunch lawyer and he didn't want similar shape and was also a strong and he also did not want to liberalize the economy. They all wanted socialism from the beginning to the end. Now, what happened as a result in this regime? The current account deficit because the imports had already been opened up by Rajiv Gandhi.
1661379334.0-1661417290.0
So the current account deficit rose from 11,350 crore to 17,350 crores in just two years time by 1991. Now 1991 what happened is Chandra taker he wanted to take over from the and he was part of the JD and he formed the JantaDal Socialist Block.
1661421390.0-1661430810.0
60 MPs came with Chandra shaker and supported by none others in the Congress Party.
1661433550.0-1661491470.0
It was the fat pulling the horse, something like that. Congress Party had 220 MPs and didn't know what to do. So he had told he had no interest absolutely in reforms. So he continued as it is but he didn't understand the track he was going in. He didn't understand that while he was Prime Minister there was a media campaign by the Congress that these guys are really damaging the economy.
1661492230.0-1661510600.0
So Congress wanted that after a few months there would be elections and they even come back and they will rule the entire thing on church. It was a fair plan for how politics run.
1661513370.0-1661530670.0
He fell into the trap and because he didn't know what to do and during BP Sims time only the foreign Exchange reserve had gone to something like 2200 crores.
1661536370.0-1661596414.0
Now Chandrashita's time, which was six months, seven months I think he stayed so at that time and we were left with something like I think six weeks import and could import six weeks. And after that there was a debt default which was made. So that was the place where Chan Shaker brought the. But it will be really foolish to blame Chandrashikar for this at the breaking point. His mistake was he came in at the breaking point but the entire deterioration started from Rajiv Gandhi's time when the imports were relaxed without the liberalization of the economy.
1661596542.0-1661612742.0
So that is what happened. So this is exactly what happened. You know why we came to the crisis point. That is how we came to the crisis. Yeah.
1661612796.0-1661661510.0
So now in July 1991 with the new government, if I'm not wrong, just a month after the government came in to power we saw the budget and the reforms that came in. So can you tell us some of the highlights of the reform and how effective did it prove in rescuing India from the brink of the default that it was in. There is another very interesting story. Before that, when these elections were held, at that time, Nasimara was not given the ticket, though he had been MP for 32 years and a minister for around 24 years, did not want him in the cabinet.
1661663610.0-1661699650.0
So Nasima Rao's biographer, he has written that Nasimar Rao was planning for he had gone from the sea. Now, what happened during the 90 91 elections is that after the first phase of elections, the day after the first phase of polling, raviv Gandhi got assassinated in Sri Param.
1661702870.0-1661709320.0
And after that the pole was postponed for about two.
1661711690.0-1661797170.0
So if you see the first, the congress would not have come back to power mostly, but because Kajeev Gandhi was assassinated, there was a massive sympathy wave and the Congress came back to power, which was very I mean, for the Congress it was very fortuous. Now, when Congress came back to power, sonia Ranji did not want to become the Prime Minister, but she did not trust Pranab Mukherji or Manmohan Singh or Jaram Rani or anybody. So Nasimara was called some retirement to help the government and Nasimara became the Prime Minister and Manmohan Singh became the so that is how the entire thing started. Now, Nasimara was quite a balanced but he also himself was associated.
1661804570.0-1661837870.0
What happened is there was a sudden transformation. I don't know why and how. There was a sudden transformation the moment Nasimara cabinet was phone in. First of all, Nasimara, he had never been the Industry Ministry, but he took charge of the industry. He was a very clever politician.
1661838210.0-1661843780.0
He realized that I have to take charge of the industry, without which nothing will happen.
1661850870.0-1661886510.0
And he was a person who really took over and revitalized the entire thing. Within the ten days of his government being sold in, he did the first round of devaluation.
1661889890.0-1661910530.0
Nobody had told him that he has to do it in ten days. But he wanted to show and everybody else that I mean business. So within ten days he went and he devalued eight person evaluation.
1661913050.0-1661942900.0
There was a feedback that that devaluation was not enough. Foreign investors were not happy with that. Three days later, on July 3 1st devaluation wasn't 1st July. Yes, it took charge on 21st July. So three days later on 3rd July, then there was another devaluation of 11%.
1661944710.0-1661978310.0
So he told people that I mean business straight up. Then what happened? He started working with his team. I think there was Naresh Chandra and there was somebody else in his cabinet, his cabinet secretary, I think was Naresh Chandra and there was Varma.
1662034450.0-1662064662.0
Now, what happened is that he started this industrial policy reforms. Now, the industrial policy reforms was a very complicated thing. This was before the budget. So he started this industrial policy reform and this industrial policy reform was not very easy. It was a very complicated thing because there were five things over here.
1662064796.0-1662104602.0
One was industrial delicensing, one was the deregulation of the sector. Then there was abolition of the MRTP Act. And then there was public sector policy of reservation and opening up to private investment and then foreign investment policy and foreign technology policy. So people say that it was the budget which was really the highlight. But it was not the budget which was the highlight, it was the industry.
1662104686.0-1662139360.0
The forms which Nasimara carried out was actually the highlight and there was no other way he could have done it. And entire industry licensing, industrial licensing. Shall I break up all these things and explain to you each of these? You can tell us about the highlights of the reform. Like what were the most important reforms that created the impact or escalated India from that situation?
1662140610.0-1662193090.0
What is this industrial D license? This was one of the for every industry, any entrepreneur set up, you have to take a license in India. Now, Rao new industrial policy cut down that to just 15 sectors where you have to take license and the remaining sectors you would go ahead without any license, which was as drastic as that. Just 15 sectors where you had to take license from government of India. Now, this license was not given previously to all the sectors.
1662193590.0-1662215494.0
Then there was deregulation of the industrial sector. Deregulation of the industrial sector was there were the labor laws, there were the excise laws, there were various other laws which were over there. Now, all those laws were very cumbersome. All those laws were simplified one by one. One by one.
1662215532.0-1662255560.0
They were simply then there was this Draconian. MRTP act monopoly and Restrictive Trade Practices Act in which if you had profits, then the government could climb down and say that you are being a monopoly and you are having excess profits and therefore you cannot operate. So that was the MRTP Act. Then private sector Policy Act. Then private sector was given certain areas where only private sector could enter, others could not enter.
1662256090.0-1662291558.0
So Nasimara's policy said that no, there won't be any reservation for these private sectors. Three areas and whatever the private public sectors were there. There were about 100 public sectors by that time. What he did is he said that let us open it up to private investment. Sure, they were all put into stock market so that people could buy shares.
1662291754.0-1662314630.0
And a part of the government money which was blocked in public sectors went was subscribed by the private and then foreign investment policy and foreign technology policy where you could bring in money from abroad.
1662319310.0-1662320860.0
So these are the five.
1662327870.0-1662357170.0
And if you see what was the result of all this? Now I will only give you one example the result of this because it's become very long and become much longer than the time permits. The top three private sector banks to Do, ICICI and Access Bank are all products of 1991 liberal rights.
1662359670.0-1662387310.0
GFC bank was founded by Housing Development Finance Corporation. At that time was Industrial Credit Corporation of India. It was a public sector unit that was the founder of ICICI Bank. And bank was founded by UTI. There was another public sector.
1662387970.0-1662413750.0
Yes. And you know what is their contribution to the banking sector today. So every sector was liberalized like this. So like he was saying in July it started with devaluation of the Rupee back to back. There were two sets of evaluation and then there was pledging of gold to increase the country's forest reserves in the middle of the month.
1662413820.0-1662452020.0
And later we saw the structural reforms in trade and industrial policy. So what was the public reaction to such dramatic developments within the span of a month that also some of the government which was newly appointed a month ago? Yes, there was a public reaction. The reaction in the cabinet itself was very strange. It is when on 24th July, just a day before the budget or the day before on 23rd July Nasimara wanted to present the new industrial policy.
1662453910.0-1662487674.0
I think the budget was on 24 July. So on 23 July he wanted to present them and they formed a cabinet committee that would look into it. But there was no consensus on the cabinet committee. Somebody leaked it to the press and there was a lot of love and ultimately the whole thing was dropped. Nasimara was a very different type of character.
1662487722.0-1662526090.0
He used to do everything silently. So usnakey he told Korean I think he was a lower level minister in the industry, maybe a minister of state or something like that. He told him that budget papers Kessar is for muzaki present evening of this thing budget. This was presented by Korean without any fanfare. Nobody came to know also that this has been presented.
1662529150.0-1662559958.0
He was a guy, you could abuse him the opposition, you would abuse him and shout and do anything. But he never opened his mouth. He used to get his things done in a very very secretive way and without any big banner advertisements. He was a different type of operator altogether. He knew how to get things done.
1662560124.0-1662600446.0
He never played enemies with anybody. He never broke only too much. So it was even at the cabinet level there was a lot of opposition. I am not talking about you see now that you saw the Farm bill, what happened despite being passed by the parliament with easy majority did not get passed by the street crowd. Literally forced the government to backtrack.

Now just imagine that in 1991 when the trade unions were very strong and everything was socialism, what type of opposition he would have. But that was the magic of Nasimara. He did everything so silently and so carefully.
1662624190.0-1662692910.0
I don't think that very few people handle could ever have the guts to go in and reform like Nasima routed. He just put the things rightly in the right place. And surprisingly, there was not all that reaction to adverse reaction to his besides the opposition at that time. So I think somehow the BJP realized that there was no other option other than supporting Rob. So that is why I think although the leftist took out a lot of processions on the street and they tried to stop the thing, but I think it was largely because of RAW's way of handling things that got ruled.

We have a relevant question here from one of our viewers. How right is it to say that Dr. Munmohan Singh was responsible for liberalization while as CEA and RBI governor and other roles he furthered the cause of the Indira Gandhi's legacy?
1662711370.0-1662769682.0
I don't think it is right to say that Dr. Manmon Singh was solely responsible for the liberalization. I think the liberalization was all Rao, this thing, because the industry ministry was under route that time. And if Manmon thing at all contributed, he contributed to the math part of it, the budget, the working out of the budget and getting the same. But I think the basic decision making and the political will behind it and the political cunningness behind it was everything was at the stamp of Raw.
1662769826.0-1662796690.0
It had no man Wansing over there. Absolutely. And that could be seen when Manman Singh got his chance to be the PM for ten years, he was not effective as Rao was during his four years of route. Rao left the stamp of the thing. So I think it was more of Rao and less of Munmonds.

I'll come to my next question here. We're almost at the end of our time. Critics have often raised the argument that the World Bank and IMF have trivia India into adopting the economic reforms of 91 to avoid sovereign default. They added that the subsequent changes in trade policies were aimed at facilitating imports for developed countries like the US. How valid would you say is the.
1662821920.0-1662883294.0
Critique now when you say this, that critiques this thing now if you see, what do you do? Three and a half decades of socialism followed by half a decade of misplaced liberalization. So four decades, and you are at a crisis level where you will default on your foreign debt obligations. So, to IMS credit, they never imposed any, I mean, conditions on India. They left Rao and Manmohan Singh to take care of the nitty gritty and these guys did it to the best of their understanding, but there was no other way.
1662883332.0-1662883920.0
Only.
1662886290.0-1662929390.0
Little diehard communist will say that those reforms were not needed. Those reforms were very much needed, because everything had failed. Socialism had failed and the writing was on the wall. How can you say that? Of course everything which you see had the IMF stamped somewhere behind it because this entire licensing, the process, the entire foreign investment policy, the foreign technology policy, the thing, everything requires some amount of research and some amount.
1662929460.0-1662944266.0
Of hard work. So all that must have come from the IMF. But they never came and imposed anything. It was rao who imposed it. And as a matter of fact, more than rao.
1662944378.0-1662959560.0
When Bachville came in took rao. This thing later he took it forward. And it shows that not only the government but the opposition also believed in the same policy.
1662961770.0-1662974780.0
As a matter of fact, bad pay made it more successful. If you see the rupee almost stabilized during the four years of Bath pay rule. It was somewhere around 43 and 45.
1662982610.0-1663025500.0
It is what the foreign investors value your economy. And when you see that the rupee is stable, that means the government is really doing well. So if you see rao's liberalization did work magic and that ten years of rao and battery rule were the best for the Indian economy. That brings me to my last question here is how do you rate the first decade that followed the reform? Did you see some any material progress in the lives of the citizen and how did the forex resolve fare after that?
1663025950.0-1663083040.0
Yes, definitely now that is a very important question because the things change drastically after the reforms and the things change drastically because what happens is unless it goes down to the people we don't understand the benefit of the reforms now what happened after the reforms? Now see, now when Rao took over and informed the nation, he put in the policies. But there was no way he could really implement what happened.
1663085970.0-1663128906.0
Bhagpay started this connecting 1.7 lakh villages through roads. Now, this was one of the areas where really for 20 years there has been a lot of hard work not only by Bathway, but by the next government. And totally we have 1.7 lakh villages connected by roads. Then the Goldman coordinator which was connecting the four metros by four lane highways. That also took another 20 years.
1663129008.0-1663145540.0
But it started during bus space time service extra program in which the compulsory education for the child. So that program also started during budget space time.
1663147590.0-1663192510.0
So the economic reforms, actually the benefit of economic reforms when it reaches to the wider population, that is the time when we understand that the reforms daily have worked and we reach the wider population. The reforms which made after route, there was this opening up of the hospital sector. Previously there was a shortage of hospitals. It was Bajpay who opened up the hospital sector, the education sector, the engineering colleges, the medical colleges. There were so few before that.
1663192660.0-1663219754.0
So it was Bajpay who opened up all these things. So all these things was their Rao plan. But because Rao had a very short duration, it was further negated by much way. And they did it. So I went the credit to both of them and it was due to Rao's liberalization form took place.
1663219872.0-1663240320.0
And actually we are in a stage, much better stage than what we had before 1991. Before 1991. The decade before 1991 was probably the worst for the Indian economy. And the decade after 1991 was probably the best.
1663243890.0-1663247060.0
Decade that immediately followed the reform. Yeah.
1663249430.0-1663278074.0
How do you think the reform is impacting us in the present decade? Right now? There is a lot of impact of that reform. That reform has been taken forward to a great level, and there has been we have not progressed as fast as we did during the first decade of economic reform. Things brought down during Manhohan Singh's time.
1663278272.0-1663306360.0
Things are not yet picked up pace during Modi's time, but we are much better off than what we were before. Overall, if you see, we are much better off. The pace is not as much like during rows time, and during the pace was much better.
1663309370.0-1663351380.0
The rupee was much more stable and everything if you say all that is not there. But still we are much better off then. And it is partly due to this reforms. The reforms plus the reforms are other reforms which has happened after that. But that was a very difficult phase because we were under influence of the Socialist government for four decades and nobody had the guts to reform, which Rao did.
1663354490.0-1663384810.0
I will not say that he did it boldly. I will say that he did it very cleverly, but it got work done. Well, that brings us to the end of our conversation here. Sandeep has wonderfully encapsulated not only what led up to the reforms, but also the economic history of India before that and what led to the crisis. Thank you so much, Sandy, for making time for us today and coming into our conversation.

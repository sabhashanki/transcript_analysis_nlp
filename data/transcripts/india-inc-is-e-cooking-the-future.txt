Hello and welcome to another episode of India End on Kilj. Today we have with us Sunil Mani is a program associate at Pew sample of energy, environment and water. Saleem is also one of the authors of a prominent study on etc in India and today we'll be talking to him about his report. We'll talk about the benefits of etc. We'll hear some misconceptions around it and we'll also address has some audience questions around the comment box on the right hand side and simulate.
1655521554.0-1655528418.0
If you are ready, we'll jump into some questions then. Sure. Anthony? Yeah, go ahead please. Great soil.
1655528434.0-1655558242.0
Do you want to start off by telling me a bit about your experience while conducting research for your study, which I think is an extremely insightful and comprehensive study by the way. And also I think it's one of the few available resources on the internet for reliable data on deep cooking. Please tell us your experience while working on the research. Yeah, so first of all, a bit about myself. I work at Council on Energy, Environment and Water.
1655558296.0-1655584460.0
It's a public policy research think tank majorly focusing on climate change and sustainability issues. And at CW, I mean, I work in the Energy Access Team and at Energy Access Team we have been conducting large scale primary surveys since last seven to eight years to understand the energy access situation in the country. And by energy access I mean cooking energy access situation and electricity access situation.
1655587390.0-1655631478.0
All of these large scale surveys that we've been conducting last to last year, right before the COVID Pandemic struck the country, we conducted a nationwide India residential energy survey. We call it Iris 2020 because it was conducted in 2020 and we captured various aspects related to electric cooking in that survey. So basically, electric cooking was just one part of the larger survey that we were trying to conduct to understand the cooking energy access situation in the country. And with electric cooking as one of the focus during the Iris survey, it gave us many insights about human behavior and human decision making in general. And I'll of course talk about them later during this discussion.
1655631654.0-1655659700.0
But yeah, the experience was wonderful and we were able to generate a lot of insights about how humans make decisions when it comes to transitioning to something new technology. So, yeah, it was a great experience, certainly. Yeah. So do you want to give us some info about what are the common perceptions you saw around cooking devices, like an induction cooktop or a rice cooker? What are the common perceptions around it that you saw while conducting these work?
1655660390.0-1655691840.0
Right, so actually the common perception depends on whether you are a user or a non user of ecooking. Right? That's a clear distinction that we found out from a survey. For example, from a survey we found that among consumers who were users of that technology, nearly 60% of them reported that it would be feasible to transition to Ecooking entirely for them and a similar share, again, 60% of them believed that Ecooking would be faster than the other alternatives such as LPG, which it indeed is.
1655693970.0-1655740730.0
Basically, users were definitely quite positive about this technology. And also, based on one of our recent estimates, we have made some calculations where we found out that at the current price of LPG refill, which is more than Rs1000 right now for a 14.2 kg refill and the prices have been increasing significantly over the past two years. So we made those calculations and we found out that electric cooking will be significantly cheaper than LPG, operationally cheaper if you are paying a per unit tariff, electricity tariff of less than Rs8.2. So it is certainly cheaper and a lot of households also realize that. But among non users of Ecooking, the perception was not very positive.
1655741230.0-1655790426.0
They are unaware about all of these aspects, as you say, that it is going to be cheaper, they are not aware about it. Significantly higher proportion of non users of Ecooking are either skeptical or uncertain about the benefits of electric cooking and very few non users are aware that it is less expensive compared to LPG. And in fact, in one of the recent studies conducted by the GIZ and Thermal Life, they found out that consumers were not willing to use e cooking in certain areas because they thought that it can give them electric shocks. Right? So this is again like one of the common misperception issue that was there and they also found that some households said that they don't want to use electric cooking because maybe the repair cost of the appliances would be very high.
1655790448.0-1655832860.0
So that is the kind of perception barrier that is there among consumers who are non users. Basically, there are all of these misinformation that people are carrying with them which need to be addressed if we really want to see a transition towards e cooking. And just to tell you, the government of India also launched the Go Electric campaign in February last year to spread the awareness on the benefits of electric cooking. And this is of course an attempt to make the electric cooking a mainstream clean cooking option in India so that the LPG import burden on the country can be reduced. So we are quite hopeful about the campaign and we hope that it will be able to address all the perception barriers that are existing in the country right now.
1655834270.0-1655861858.0
You were just mentioning a few barriers to adopting electric booking. Like people think it's going to be costly, more electricity bill will come, that there's going to be an electric shock or something. How much of that is misinformation and how much of that you think is an actual logical barrier to adoption? Yeah, most of them are actually misinformation, but there are certain genuine concerns as well. So I'll talk about a few of them.
1655861944.0-1655903586.0
So for example, this issue with the adaptability of the technology, right? I mean, the e cooking Technology Director cooking technology. So, just to give you some stats, in our survey, we found that at all India level, we found among e cooking users, 95% of the Ecooking users had an LPG connection connection, and 92% of the users actually relied on LPG as their primary cooking fuel, which means that they're not using electric cooking regularly, right? They're still dependent on LPG for most of their cooking. In fact, when we asked them about the frequency of usage, only half of the electric cooking users said that they use electric cooking every day, and that's only for some of their cooking needs.
1655903608.0-1655933322.0
So basically, they're just using it to complement their cooking needs, but not really as a major source of cooking. And the barrier behind this is because you cannot cook a lot of meals, it doesn't really allow you to allow you that flexibility to cook a lot of meals, right? For example, you cannot cook chapati on an induction cook stuff. So all of those barriers that are there, so this is certainly a genuine barrier and that needs to be addressed. So, yeah, that's there.
1655933376.0-1655943470.0
And then there were also other barriers that various studies have pointed out. For example, lack of reliable power supply.
1655945490.0-1655980878.0
If you don't get reliable power supply, how would you rely on electric cooking? Right? So, again, that is another barrier that various households reported, and that's what we found even in our survey, that households who were facing quality issues in power supply, they were significantly lesser likely to use electric cooking for most of their cooking needs. And finally, as I said, even though I said that electric cooking is going to be significantly cheaper, but it also depends on the electricity tariffs that you are paying, right? I hope you know that in India we have slab wise electricity tariffs.
1655980914.0-1656013282.0
For example, if you consume between zero to 10, you are charged a certain tariff and then the moment your consumption goes above 100 unit, the tariff increases, right? For example, let's say for zero to 100, it would be RS5 per unit. It goes to RS7 per unit at the next level. So recently, today itself, I was speaking with somebody from Karmata and he told me that as long as his monthly consumption, electricity consumption, goes above 100 units, he has to pay a tariff of Rs12 per unit. That is, again a very important barrier, right?
1656013336.0-1656037340.0
So certainly that cooking is not really cheap, but that is a barrier only for a very few population. Mostly in India, the average tariff, that Indian household space is around Rs5.5. So certainly Ecooking is going to be significantly cheaper. So, yeah, that's about, for example, in Delhi, we get up to 200 units. Three.
1656038350.0-1656057870.0
In a situation like that, it might be more cost effective to use induction cook top. Yeah. So thank you for bringing this up. Actually, I was about to talk about that only. So we also looked at state level penetration of e cooking and we found that Tamil Nadu and Delhi have the highest proportion of electric cooking users in India.
1656057950.0-1656091386.0
Right. And when we tried to understand the determinants of higher adoption of electric cooking appliances in these states, it turned out to be a tariff. For example, Tamil Nadu, which has the highest ecooking adoption rate in India, they provide very heavy subsidies on residential electricity consumption. So for example, households consuming up to 100 units in two months receive free of cost electricity there. And even if you cross that 100 units, there's a very huge subsidy there.
1656091488.0-1656120178.0
Similarly, in Delhi, as you pointed out, right, households consume more than 200 units per month are going to get 100% subsidy on their specific consumption. And even for households who are in the range of 200 to 400, even for them, the consumption is 50% subsidized. Right. So that's certainly a reason why we see higher adoption in certain states. In fact, recently various other states also, like Punjab and all, they have announced free electricity for a certain category of households.
1656120194.0-1656150302.0
Right. So we might expect to see a higher increased adoption of e cooking in those states as well. And do you think also one of the barriers could be that when we buy an induction cooktop, for example, I have a very common model, which is a prestige model, which is only one cooktop. So having one cooktop or a household, I said minimum four is extremely impractical when an oven gives me two or three. So that could be a barrier to adoption as well for a normal Indian family.
1656150436.0-1656188134.0
Absolutely. In fact, again, I'll just give you another example. So in that GIZ study that I talked about, basically what happened was basically they had distributed some free induction stuff to some households and then they monitored the usage pattern and they found that induction was getting used during breakfast and dinner, but not during lunch. Why? Because breakfast and dinner, you cook lesser meals, but when it comes to lunch, you want to have variety of variety of dishes for your meal.
1656188262.0-1656210130.0
Which is why that was a pattern that they observed that during lunch they were not using at all the induction stuff. So even as you said, like the family size and also the variety of dishes that you want to have in your meal. Right, that is also another factor because you can just cook one thing at a time on an induction cook stuff. So yeah, that's certainly there. Certainly.
1656210200.0-1656237626.0
So I think two things are getting out of this is that if we get other models which can be completely replaced, which can completely replace an oven with two or three stops at the same time, that would be a better way for at least Indian families to adapt to it. Yes, definitely. But then there are such models available, but if you look at the price, they are very high. It will cost you like 15,000, $20,000. So there's no point in going for that.
1656237808.0-1656256240.0
Especially in India, the affordability barrier is already there. Right. So even richer households wouldn't want to buy such a device. Right. But in the long term, you're saying that it's more cost effective if it's combined with the subsidence electricity rate.
1656257250.0-1656272226.0
Absolutely, yeah. So do you want to talk a bit more about which states did you see with the higher adoption? Like you said, Tamil Nadu and Delhi had a higher adoption. Are there any other states where you see there was higher adoption? And which states had like the lowest adoption in India?
1656272258.0-1656286714.0
Right. Lowest adoption was mostly eastern states like Bihar, Chattisgar, Jharkhand. Right. Because they are poorer. Again, because economics plays a great role in determining whether you transition to ecooking or not.
1656286752.0-1656312514.0
Because of course you have to spend RS2000 on the ecooking appliance and then similar amount on buying the compatible utensils as well. Right. Because you can't really use the utensils that were there that you were using with LPG. So for eastern states it was the lowest, and as I said, for Tamila, Ado and Delhi and even like southern Indian states like Kerala, which are again richer. Right.
1656312552.0-1656323878.0
So again, economics plays a significant role there. But one pattern was really surprising here, which was Assam being in East Indian state coming from northeast. Right. It's not very rich. Right.
1656323964.0-1656356814.0
But still we saw that more than 10% of the households in Assam were using electric organ. That was surprising to us as to why that is happening. So when we tried to basically understand that, we found a lot of households there were using electric coil based electric coil based cooking devices. Hope you're aware that there used to be those electric coil based cooking devices which used to consume very high amount of electricity and they are very cheap. They cost around RS200.
1656356862.0-1656358660.0
Right. So they were using that.
1656361590.0-1656396974.0
The thing was that of course, it would have been incurring a very high electricity consumption. But then when we asked them for a copy of their electricity bill to those households, very few of them were having a copy because during the survey, that was also one of the things that we had kept in our questionnaire, that we have to get a copy of the electricity bill. Right. But very few of them had a copy of the electricity bill and when we asked them for the monthly electricity expenditure, how much do they spend? They said that most of them couldn't remember the monthly electricity bill.
1656397012.0-1656416410.0
Right. So this suggests that maybe those are the households who are not actually paying for the electricity, which is why you see a higher adoption there. Right. So basically this suggests that in states which have more incidences of electricity theft right. Those are also the states where we can see higher adoption of ecommerce.
1656416430.0-1656421400.0
But this is certainly not an optimal outcome for the distribution companies in India because they are already in a mess. Right.
1656425210.0-1656451200.0
Did you also see the adoption concentrated in urban areas more than Semi, Doodle or Google? Absolutely. In urban India, we found around 10% of the households owning an electric cooking appliance, whereas in rural India it was only around 3%. Do you think you also to do with their supply of electricity because there are more power cuts that side? Absolutely.
1656451570.0-1656477034.0
Supply is certainly a factor here, but it's also about the affordability, right? Because urban households are richer and they can afford it. It's a mix of all of those factors. The electricity being cheaper and then having more income, and then also about getting a better quality power supply and then also being more informed about the technology. Because as I said, the perception barriers that are there.
1656477072.0-1656505074.0
Right. Those perception barriers are less likely to be there among urban households. So all of those factors together contribute to a higher adoption rate in urban India. And also there's a lack of awareness about how to operate the device as well because it comes with numerous buttons and numerous temperature settings. So that would need an actual awareness setting to tell families to how to use it, which is not probably very prevalent now.
1656505192.0-1656519550.0
Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. That is certainly yeah, that is part of the awareness bit only. Yeah. So I'll come to my next question is, I mean, we noticed the major part of power generation in India is also primarily dependent on coal.
1656519630.0-1656555886.0
Right? Now, if I'm not wrong, around 75% of the power generation is still dependent on coal. So how environmentally efficient do you think is electric cooking devices which are powered by as opposed to Ltd? Yeah, so there are two aspects to it. One is basically the way we pursue clean cooking energy access is the argument that we provide is for basically it's a public health debate because a lot of households are using solid fuels for cooking, which actually creates a lot of smoke.
1656555918.0-1656566440.0
Right. Indoor air pollution. And indoor air pollution is also contributes significantly to the ambient air pollution in the country. Like whatever air pollution that we are witnessing in the country right now. Right.
1656567690.0-1656600958.0
As per one of CW's studies, around 2030% to 50% of the ambient air pollution that we have in the country is because of the indoor air pollution coming out of burning off these solid fuels of cocaine. Right. So the argument here is about the indoor air pollution, public health and all of that. Right. So once we move to a cleaner source like LPG or electric cooking, we are at least able to solve for that public health issue.
1656601124.0-1656615422.0
Right now it depends on basically at the end user level, it is absolutely clean. Okay. And that is the objective right now. But you're also right that from pollution perspective it's great. But then from climate change perspective.
1656615486.0-1656633450.0
Yes, you're right. As you said, we procure most of our electricity, generate most of our electricity through coal. Right. And it is of course it has BHG implications. That aspect is certainly there, but that is a longer term climate change sort of a debate and that has to be dealt with differently.
1656635150.0-1656674086.0
And of course we'll have to integrate more and more renewable energy into our grid system to make it cleaner at the generation level as well. Right, but right now, in the short term term, the objective is more about making the clean cooking solution cleaner at the end user level. So probably as India moves towards this renewable energy goals of 2017, we'll see more of this coal dependency decreasing and power generation coming from solar or hydro. So that probably would be solving some of this problem in the next few decades. Absolutely.
1656674268.0-1656695680.0
And since we have already announced 2017 net zero right. So we're definitely going to see an increased adoption of renewable energy and integration of renewable energy into our grid system and that will certainly make it cleaner, right? Yeah. So we are almost at the end of our session. So I'll come to one last question.
1656697330.0-1656731110.0
I see one question from the audience, which is pretty similar to what I was going to ask. Do you think that ecooking devices are going to be the future primary cooking sources in India? I mean, we see a lot of barriers where you can't make full cars or you can't make kitchen things. At the same time there's an upfront cost, there is a matter of electricity supply. With all these barriers existing, do you see this becoming the primary source in the future, say in the next few decades?
1656731450.0-1656752494.0
Right. So, as we've already discussed, there are so many barriers. So of course, once we are only able to solve for those barriers, we will be able to see a sustained transition. And for that we have provided various recommendations in our report as well. Of course, first of all, because ecommerce appliances are expensive, right?
1656752612.0-1656765940.0
So government will need to incentivize R and D to come up with low cost electric cooking solutions. And government is really, really interested in promoting electric cooking because LPG is import dependent, it's fossil fuel, right?
1656768070.0-1656803266.0
And government spends a lot of money on subsidizing LPG, I mean, used to spend, but of course subsidies are no longer there, but they have just introduced it for the PMU households. Because of all of those reasons, government is planning to promote e cooking. And that certainly is the future according to me. But just that if we are able to incentivize research and development for low cost electric cooking solutions so that even for poorer households can become equal participants in clean cooking energy transition. And also because upfront cost is a big barrier, we also need to devise innovative financial solutions, right?
1656803368.0-1656834506.0
Such as offering loans at attractive interest rates and flexible payment options so that can stimulate the demand for ecooking devices. And as you already pointed out, and one person has already put that in the comment, no million India is actually complete without full car. Right? So you also need to improve the adaptability of ecooking devices so that it suits the culinary habits of households from different cultural backgrounds. And of course, again, we will need a lot of R and D to address this issue.
1656834688.0-1656875110.0
So that is there. And then we also need to ensure reliable and quality electricity services, as we've already discussed, again, like to enable households so that they can trust on the technologies, they can rely on e cooking so that they don't feel the need for a backup when they are actually planning to rely on e cooking. And even though power separate services in India have improved significantly in the past few years, in our survey we found many households who reported facing issues like unpredictable power outages, occasional extended blackout and voltage fluctuations. Right? So all of those issues are there which can again hamper the growth.
1656875450.0-1656894400.0
So, yeah, that's there. And finally, of course, we also need to conduct in depth studies to capture the household experiences and perception of the diverse social context. Right? Because we don't know what exactly consumers want. So we'll have to conduct more and more pilots to understand the perception, the barriers which are there.
1656895010.0-1656927430.0
And only these studies can help guide future policy interventions related to electric cooking in India. And at CW, we are actually planning for more such interventions in the coming times. We are actually planning to provide certain induction cook stuff to certain households and then monitoring the usage pattern. And based on that, coming up with practical policy recommendations as to how we can move towards e cooking as a sustainable solution for all in a household. Yeah, I think that answers Nikita's question.
1656927500.0-1656948400.0
Well, that R and D cannot just solve this change. There has to be a behavioral change in consumer consumption pattern for these devices. And I think, like you were saying, this is a policy level change that you have to make. And this should be a part of the awareness program and part of the Go Electric campaign that the government is launching. Right?
1656949730.0-1656974774.0
Do you think there is a timeline to this? What sort of timeline do you see for this to ramp up? Timeline for sorry. Timeline for this adoption to increase and government to spend more time on promoting the Go Electric campaign. So timeline is right now because as you can see, the price of LPG has gone above Rs1000, right?
1656974892.0-1656987260.0
And it has become really unaffordable for many, many Indian households. Right? Everybody is complaining about that. And in rural India, people have already shifted back to solid fuels. Right?
1656988430.0-1657017954.0
In fact, we've been hearing in the news that a lot of households who got free LPG refills under Pradhan Mantri Ujala Yogana scheme, right? They were also selling the cylinders that they had received in the secondary market. Right. So basically, whatever money that you spent in PMU scheme and all of that right. That is certainly not really giving us results as I mean, the results to the extent that we expected.
1657018002.0-1657038362.0
Right? So definitely we need to right away start promoting this as an alternative. Otherwise it's going to be a really big problem because we don't know when the war is going to be over. We don't know when the global oil prices are going to be stabilized. Right.
1657038416.0-1657066710.0
There's a lot of uncertainty globally, and we can't really live under that level of uncertainty, especially for an essential item like cooking fuel. Right. So basically, I think the time is now to start listening. Thank you so much for this conversation, which is really insightful, and thank you so much for taking the time out today to come on our platform. I really hope to see you back here soon for another rewriting conversation.
1657067130.0-1657076070.0
Pleasure. Pleasure to be here. And I also hope that the audience learned something from the discussion. Yeah. Thank you so much.
1657076220.0-1657078580.0
Thank you. Thank you, auntie. Bye bye. Take care.

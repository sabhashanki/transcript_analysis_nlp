{"summary": "Folsey Jalali is an award winning playwright, actor, and director. He's recently directed a play called Strictly Unconventional. At St Radios school, the protagonist was always a woman. \"My school principal was, of course, feminist. And all of her plates used to write most of them,\" she says. After four years of undergrad, I applied for grad school in my last year, and I got in immediately. And of course, at that point, people are like, oh, theater, you do theatre. Because it I think theater is my heart, and I just have my hands in the pockets of the film so that they can give me money so I can do it. Theater, I think it's as simple as that for me. But you you never considered, like, a full fledged career in film. That was As a maker film, I don't think that theater is on the bottom rung of the ladder of various entertainment platforms. I think it's on a different ladder itself, by virtue of In 2013, what happened was that I had a breakup. I started with Chihandi and I made it a 20 minutes, one moment show. And I wrote it haphazardly and all 25 pages. Then I submitted it. I was saying I have I never considered myself a writer. But I shared it slowly, slowly, and people kind of liked it.

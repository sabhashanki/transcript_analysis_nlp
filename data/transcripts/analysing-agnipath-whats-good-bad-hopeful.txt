Good afternoon. Hello and welcome to this edition of Profit Motive Today, where we discuss the Ognipad scheme and what it means for India's Armed Forces, what it means for employment in India, and just look at what the views across the border. Today's session, I'll be co hosting with Sakura, who is the founding partner at Deepstrat and head of content at Kulki. And esteemed guest this evening is left in General DS Huda, who is the former Northern Army commander of the Indian Army. We will also be joined later by Dr.
1657854012.0-1657897880.0
Triptyi Singh, who is the Chief Learning Officer at Sentiment Learning, who's had a long storyte career working in the learning and development space. And she's going to give us some views about how ugly, once they finish their tourism duty, how they can be integrated into the civilian workforce. So, before we start the discussion, I just want to give a brief about what the Album Path scheme is, which is newly announced government program which offers four year short term contractual engagements for soldiers with the Indian Armed Forces. It was announced by the Defense Minister last month with the service chiefs. And since the announcement, there's been a lot of mixed response to it.
1657898410.0-1657934894.0
We've seen lacks and lacks of applicants apply this year for position as Ugnivirs. We've also seen widespread protests across the country. We've seen a lot of unrest. Because at a time when employment statistics show that there's a lot of unemployment and struggles for jobs, struggle for income earning opportunities among the youth, a government job has always been something that every average Indian aspires to. Because of the stability of income.
1657934942.0-1657947510.0
Stability in terms of pensions, post retirement and a short tour of duty is not what people were expecting. So there's been a lot of protests, there's a lot of litigation pending in courts.
1657949530.0-1657969580.0
Obviously, it's caused a lot of controversy and we want to try and make sense of that today. So, General Hoda, if you could just give us your brief early comments on what you make of the scheme, whether you think on average it's good or bad.
1657971630.0-1657989970.0
So thanks for inviting me. Thanks. Saga I think it's an important topic and subject. As you said, it's been under discussion for some years internally within the military and with the political leadership. And after it was announced, there have been mixed reactions.
1657990550.0-1658026480.0
I think we need to take a very dispassionate kind of view, because just like any scheme, it has its advantages. There are positives to the scheme. There are also some genuine concerns which have been voiced primarily by the veteran community, people who have retired from service. So very briefly, and we can discuss these maybe in detailed data, but very briefly, let me list out the positives and the concerns. The positives, obviously, are, as has been brought out by the government, a younger age profile for people.
1658026930.0-1658057290.0
Every four years, you are going to be turning over young people in the system. So they are hoping that more and more tech savvy people will come into the system. Levels of technology as it is are going to increase. So these are people who are increasingly going to be able to handle it. If you are going to retain only 25%, after four years, you will be able to take the best plot and retain them in the army and that becomes your junior leadership at the level of non commissioned officers and junior commissioned officers.
1658058350.0-1658094766.0
What is not being openly stated by the government. And again, we can discuss this in detail. It's going to have at some time, not immediately, a positive impact on the budget, because a lot of our budget currently goes towards salaries and pensions that over a period of time will reduce. And therefore you have more money for capital expenditure, you have more money for modernization of the forces. And finally, and again, the government is not saying this, but it is going to lead to some serious restructuring within the military because numbers are reducing.
1658094958.0-1658124910.0
As you've seen the last two years, there have been no recruitment, so numbers have already gone down. It is going to force a restructuring which was essential on the military. So these are, I think, some of the positives out of the scheme. There are concerns about what I call intangible but absolutely crucial factors and which are how will it impact unit Cohesion, how is it going to impact the morale of soldiers? How is it going to impact bonding that is there in unit?
1658126050.0-1658146514.0
How is it going to impact the ethos of the military? Are people going to look at this just as a temporary job? We always say the military is not a profession, it's a calling. And so these are some issues. I said they are intangible but they are highly, highly critical.
1658146562.0-1658186322.0
And crucial, I don't have any answers as to how these intangibles will play out in the future, but I think this is something that needs to be looked at and if necessary, there must be flexibility to review the whole system based on what lessons we learn out of this. So that, very briefly is my take on team is bought. It has, as I said, is positive and it has some general concerns that are being expressed by people. So how it's going to be implemented I think is going to be the key. Right, okay.
1658186376.0-1658209160.0
Before we go into further detail, I just want to invite thanks Dr. Troops singh for joining us. To everybody who's joined us now, dr. Trupi Singh is the chief Learning Officer at Sentiment Learning and she's a long career working within the learning and development space. So we're hoping, ma'am, that you can later take us through what you think.
1658210890.0-1658250120.0
What are the skilling required for a Navy once they leave the armed forces and how they will integrate into the civilian workforce. But before that we just want to stay on the topic of ugly purpose a little bit more psychic. You've covered the military during your career as a journalist, so I'm sure you have a lot of views about how these things work. For instance, when I was talking about morale, this is something that's very important for units to come together and work together, especially in such dangerous situations. So you have any questions for Dr.
1658250970.0-1658263770.0
General Huda? Now? Yeah, thanks. I think I should also use this opportunity to speak a little more about General Huda and Dr. Chipt Singh and why they're here.
1658263920.0-1658302770.0
General Huda, as we pointed out, is a former Northern Army commander from the Indian Army and he was commissioned into the Gurkha ISIL and probably one of the few really fine generals he had. In fact, he was in command of Northern Command when he had the surgical attacks, the surgical strike which took place in 2016. So his opinion would be very valuable to us in this debate. And why we have Dr. Singh also is because the way the scheme has been designed for years in the army and after that the government says that they'll be in a position to be employed.
1658302850.0-1658341310.0
So Dr. Singh, the kind of background she comes from, she'll be able to give us a better insight into what kind of jobs would these people be eligible for and if they are to be upskilled and what kind of learning and development programs they should go through. Or maybe the army could create a small post retirement course for them which will make them much more eligible, et cetera. So those are the aspects we want to discuss in this. But sir, you mentioned the operational part, that here is a situation where this may and you called it an intangible or an incongruble that this may affect our operational capability.
1658341390.0-1658368620.0
Now, we all know the army is getting increasingly modernized. In the 80s we had revolution in military affairs RMA then we had network centric operations. And now we are seeing much more aspects which four pier beginning to call full spectrum war and so on and so forth. In a situation like this, obviously our soldiers need a much higher degree of training, a much higher degree of professionalism. My first basic question is four years enough to train themselves?
1658370190.0-1658394786.0
So psychic, again, my own personal experience, one is the reduction in basic training from what used to be about nine months to six months. And nine months was also very basic training. Thereafter they would go for advanced training. So for example, the tank men would go and their own tank, the Atlantic guy would go and do his own training. The technical guy would do that.
1658394808.0-1658434666.0
Now all that is being cut off. You have only six months of basic training and the rest of the learning is going to be within the unit. So one is that the kind of, should I say, training infrastructure that exists in training centers with a V units. Training centers obviously have better infrastructure. So on the job training I think to a large extent has its limitations and my own experience is for a soldier to become really adept in his job, to bond with the unit, to be able to be given good responsibilities.
1658434858.0-1658461370.0
It takes like three to four years and unfortunately after four years we are going to lose a majority of these. So there's very constant training that is going to be carried out in units. And psychic you have seen, I worry see everybody is not going to be put in the same situation. You have been to ladakh. You've seen the Cargill sector.
1658462030.0-1658490530.0
Now here you are having soldiers in 20 men post, ten men post deployed all along the line of control. Are you going to be able to actually give them any facilities or further training? Are you actually going to be able to people are saying we'll skill them and give them 12th class education. You are aware light comes for 2 hours in a day to the generator. So I think we need to understand the kind of conditions that are going to be there on ground.
1658492470.0-1658554102.0
Which is why my own personal sense is four years in a unit and very quick turnover I think could impact particularly the fighting units and such units may have a minimal impact in technical arms and technical services but certainly the fighting units will get impacted. Which is why I was thinking about from there are only two major arms that I really understand in the army, which is the infantry and the special forces. Special forces again needs a lot of highly specialized training, equipment, understanding of equipment, et cetera. So we leave park that sort of even in the basic infantry unit as a part of a section platoon company. Again, this is an evolutionary process which forget about the officers, the or rather rank the dogs have to go through and is four years really adequate with, as you rightly pointed out, with just six months of basic training and there is no infrastructure in the units, especially units which are on a deployment in an operational road.
1658554236.0-1658603046.0
Plus the fact that we I mean a lot of people probably don't understand this but the infantry for example has a large commitment towards specialized units like the last year rifles. So there again, if you are to send a large chunk of your units because each last year rifle also has a regimental affiliation so each battalion from the regiment has to send people there. In a situation like this bone our infantry units, our basic common fighting units become really hamstrung. Yes, susa I think we will not face the problem in the initial few years. People are talking about the first year you only have like 10% or less than 10% of the military actually transiting to the agnevade sort of garden and agnewade system.
1658603228.0-1658642814.0
I think the real problem will possibly start coming in after five or six years. And there have been various calculations. I think the army itself has said is that in the next ten years, 50% of the army will actually be composed of agneweds. And you are right in saying of that 50%. When you look at infantry battalions and infantry units, who are the people who are going to go out to what we call, ere, extra regiment deployment, like the Rusted rifles, to brigade headquarters, to division headquarters, to courses of instruction as instructors, it'll probably be the regular carter.
1658642862.0-1658698374.0
And so you might find that in the infantry units per se, you could have maybe 60, 65% of the unit composed only of Ognivates. So it could have some kind of impact, although I said possibly won't happen in the next four or five years. But gradually, as we shift more and more to the agnivate system, you could see that, and which is why my recommendation, which I have also made in writing in some newspapers, was, please treat the initial few years like a pilot project or a test bed, and then look at it and how it stands out. And then if you want to make major changes, significant changes, you should have the flexibility to be able to make them. Can I just jump in here?
1658698412.0-1658744102.0
So I'm curious, as a layperson, there are different models of inducting soldiers across the world. And something the government has said while announcing Ugnipat was that they looked at these models in the US, in China, in Germany, in Russia, and they've realized that this is something that's workable because of those reasons. And we also have we know that countries like Israel, South Korea have mandatory military service for a couple of years. So what are their learnings from there that we can maybe transpose to when we're introducing the scheme here? So we can I mean, there's no harm in seeing best practices that are carried out the world over.
1658744236.0-1658779840.0
And you've given examples of various recruitment models that exist. I think some of that is also peculiar to that particular country. Okay, take Israel, for example, just does not have enough MANFar to be able to man the military. And therefore they have this system of conscripts where people come in for a little while, so they are well trained. So when you need to mobilize the army, then a very large number of civilians who have been trained in military duties come in.
1658781110.0-1658814860.0
That's their own special requirement because of the kind of threats that they are facing all around. There are countries where you don't have enough people who are attracted to join the military. And I think Taiwan is once an example, and therefore they say, look, then conscription is the answer. There are many countries where people would like to come and serve for a short period. So the US military, I think, has also a two year contract that's because people want to come in.
1658815230.0-1658832286.0
People want to come in and serve for a shorter duration. Our conditions are a little different. I mean, why is this protest going on? Because people do not find this four year scheme as sort of attractive to them. How it pans out in the future?
1658832388.0-1658860220.0
Let us see. As I said, we don't have all the answers yet because it's just getting implemented. And so let's look at it for a few years, have the flexibility to make changes where changes are required. So we have to look at our own sort of peculiar conditions. While we can take some sense and practices from other militaries, I think our situation is fairly unique in the kind of responsibilities that the military has.
1658861950.0-1658878922.0
Okay, dr. Duffer Singh, if I can bring you in here we looked at how there are different models of conscription across the world. And with the example of the US. For instance, the military is seen as one way of making a career. Because they are out of high school, they joined the military.
1658878986.0-1658890580.0
And then in the past there's been a GI bill which subsidizes college education, which offers employment post military careers. And even now, military careers are quite common.
1658892630.0-1658900680.0
The four year term of duty in the military is pushed as one way of jumping off into different careers in the future. Right.
1658904010.0-1658920590.0
Is that something you think that can be replicated here? Because it requires a lot of public investment for one. But what aspects of it do you think can be replicated? And like General Hoda said, what are the differences that we have to be careful about when we're trying to implement this in India?
1658923090.0-1658981450.0
When I'm looking at this situation, I'm listening to General again. The thoughts that were running in my mind is that definitely we need to think from the ground level. Now when we are talking about putting them into four years kind of a journey and then selecting in a way we are saying that we are selecting the top post out of those total population taken in 25% of that only. Now what are we doing with that four years? That would make a great difference in the sense if we are just giving six months training, what General was talking and then getting on to on job, are we I mean, very clear in terms of what are the different specialization that we are giving to the courses.
1658981610.0-1659108982.0
And in my mind it was that if we can consider these four years as a graduation degree for people for the journey, because this is a year by age 17 to 23 is the age in which normal human, I mean normal other people who are not joining the armed forces also do graduation. So if we can develop a curriculum kind of a thing which gives a specific training as per the requirement of the army also and also to prepare them, people who are especially I mean, right from the year one if we are able to identify the high performers who are to be selected, who are watched and at the same time keep every year reducing the number rather than just going on the last year and then kind of reducing the number all of a sudden so that you have a focus development of people as far as career, in terms of if you have a graduation degree, kind of a thing that is given there, you have a career outside because you're already coming. Trained and especially military training in various areas, whether it's technical area or even as life, managing life experiences in itself is very strong. So that would really make them very suitable, maybe more suitable as compared to the general population. I would say definitely even at our school level we need to enhance the training related to military training even at the school level so that people are seriously considering this as a career choice rather than just going career choice to be successful.
1659109126.0-1659181790.0
Because anyone if you look at the general population also people in India at least people are defining their career either by choice of the parents or driven by herd mentality going for engineering, medical and other things. But main choice, individual choice comes after graduation. So why not are we and as far as when we are saying four years, even after four years, government should think that there should be proper career guidance for each individual. There has to be an assessment related to their passion area and the strength area that they have developed gained during the army years and before that and then leave them. So instead of saying that you move out after four years, you may move out after four and a half years or five years, but you come go with that another one year of specific training to give them the degree.
1659182450.0-1659214970.0
But can I come in here? I think we are not discussing about training in schools so that they're ready for a military career. And what we are trying to understand is what happens to them after they have come out of the army. And the point that we are trying to understand is that basically you take a proper normal infantry soldier, he will have training in arms, he will have training in combat. So after four years of learning and probably also experiencing combat, the person will be asked to leave.
1659215120.0-1659241182.0
75% of those people inducted will be asked to leave the army. What kind of jobs would they be suitable for? That's the point that we are trying to understand. See, if you are talking about specific areas, we will have to think say if you are talking about infantry or if you are what is that engineering Division of army see the bulk of. The army is the fighting forces, is the fighting force and within that is the bulk is the infantry.
1659241326.0-1659282666.0
So let us talk about it from the point of view of the bulk that if an infantry boy who has trained at the age, as you said, 17 south for four years at the age of 21 is asked, that okay, your service is over, and we no longer need you. At that point, at 21 years of age, what kind of jobs would be suitable for this job? See, are we saying that they cannot go into police, they cannot go for any civilian work, any further education? We are asking you, we are asking you that what kind of jobs would they be suitable for? And we are not asking you from a point of view of police or central government jobs.
1659282778.0-1659303298.0
In the private sector, what are the areas they would be most employed in the private sector? Most of the organizations have security. You have been part of the security personnel and the security of this thing. So most organizations have security and most army officials are absorbed in that function. In corporates.
1659303474.0-1659353320.0
In addition to that, I'm saying that why are we thinking that their learning is going to stop? I'm saying that instead of that, they are eligible for all jobs in corporate if they are given specific training related to their area of specialization. So after graduation, you are given training to be whether management, management training, management classes, you are given training for especially technical areas, graphic designing or skill development. We can have specific training related to that. So every area there is no, because that's not especially in the current world, learning would never stop.
1659353850.0-1659382278.0
And this learning that they have got, they can leverage it to excel in any field that they go. There are HR officials who are from army. There are people who are in operations who are doing very well. There are many officials who are doing finance area. They are doing very well in skill set, especially if you are talking about skill sets.
1659382314.0-1659417660.0
Definitely if you are looking at the data related to economic data related to population, definitely there are either the low skilled jobs have risen, the demand for low skilled jobs have risen in corporate or very high skilled jobs. So we need to decide as to where the individual would want to go. So if you're talking about high skilled job, we would have to help them to train to get the high skill jobs. As far as a low skilled job, office boys and other things, definitely that would be there.
1659420190.0-1659449782.0
That would be a plus point for any individual coming from army to join those kind of jobs. Right, so you're saying that there should be a structured training program that's available to Agnevis that is publicly funded and that they can avail of once they leave. Yeah, I'm saying that. Is that what you're implying? We should say that it is a continuation of four years and that one year is specific training.
1659449836.0-1659489940.0
We need to have specific training in different areas of their interest where they want to specialize in or they have gained some experience being in the army itself because army also people are in different, I would say different sectors that they are working in. But are you saying that the military should be providing this training after the government should provide? Yeah. Okay. Because if I was a 21 year old who's just finished term of duty, I don't think that's hard to imagine, but if I were, I'll be far behind my peers in education.
1659492150.0-1659540558.0
My peers would be starting their first jobs, will be getting their first sight. It's also a psychological thing when I see that someone who starts in school with me who's now an engineer and I'm not yeah. So I would disagree to this tool to some extent because when you are saying that, okay, I will feel that I'm behind my peer. We are thinking that education and skill sets, success in any work or corporate is only about specific skills or degree or qualification. So I would say any person with a rigorous army training for four years would be much ahead on these life skills.
1659540734.0-1659557640.0
And therefore definitely we need to groom people and that is a grooming period. I'm saying take six months to one year specific grooming of people to get into the civil life.
1659560910.0-1659579520.0
Yes. Leaving them just after four years would have impact. Some people may adjust, others may find it difficult. So you need to have a service around that how to help them to develop the mindsets. So there needs to be some investment into the transition also.
1659582370.0-1659614598.0
Okay, second, anything you want to bring up? I think where Doctor Singh is coming from, I suspect there is she's talking about it from an officer's point of view because most of the area she mentioned is usually the retired officers who are in finance, personnel, etc. Which is a different Carter. And here we are talking about other ranks. Basically, you will join the army after passing out from class twelve and actually get a formal education only after they have left the army or they have been asked to do so, which is where I would like to bring in General Buddha.
1659614694.0-1659649670.0
So I don't know if you dealt with aspects of resettlement or when you were the CEO of your unit and you would see young boys leaving, et cetera. As far as your experience goes, and I'm only talking about other lines, which is the soldiers or NCOs? Where do you see so far what has been your experience as far as their employment is concerned? Whether it is in the central government or whether it is in the private sector? Do you think there is a huge demand for soldiers, other rents?
1659653050.0-1659683570.0
Second one is there is a slight difference because soldiers that are leaving now are leaving after about 15 to 20 years of service. And so the age profile is quite different. Experience is quite different. Not only my experience, but data suggests that we have not been able to employ them adequately at all. Even where there are reservations for exhibition in various government agencies, public sector undertaking.
1659684150.0-1659717770.0
I think the data shows that we have not at all been able to meet those quotas. And so therefore, our current experiences that the ex servicemen, when they go, and particularly I'm talking of the nontechnical streams, the infantry, the archady, the armor corps, et cetera, find it extremely difficult to get, I would say, an honorable kind of a job or settlement outside. However, what we are going to see is people leaving after four years. So the profile is different. They are younger.
1659720430.0-1659765450.0
My own sense psychic is you probably won't have problems for people who are joining technical arm, people who are doing technical training. It would be much easier. However, let us also realize that 60% of army's recruitment is going to be from people who are only 10th pass. So 10th pass is what is going to come in is about 50% to 60% of the army takes in students who have cleared the 10th exam and we are saying that after this four years we'll give them a 12th class certificate. A 12th class certificate only combat skills he knows.
1659767070.0-1659817382.0
I think it is this lot that we need to focus on as to how we can absorb them. Now the easiest cycle would have been if these people had been directly absorbed into central on police forces, palam RP forces, police because the skills are quite similar to what they require. Unfortunately the Ministry of Home Affairs has been, I know they have said now 10% intake. But the side stepping of military people into police forces is something unfortunately that has been resisted for a long time by the Minister of Home Affairs and I hope that they sort of review this because that would be one way of taking these people and ensuring them of a job. Otherwise we will have to put in place some programs after they leave the army.
1659817526.0-1659863814.0
As I said, particularly people who are just going with the 12th certificate to be able to see what kind of jobs they get. Now, you don't also want like the soldier who has served in the army to be sitting with a twelve bore gun outside a bank. I don't think that would be good for morale and it's absolutely important that we are able to adjust most of the agnews going out of the system. Otherwise what could happen is the attractiveness of the military as a career could reduce and therefore where we are seeing lacks and lacks of vacancies people wanting to join. If the attractiveness of the career reduces, the quality of people who are going to come into the military will also get impacted.
1659863942.0-1659894974.0
So I think it's important that we are able to adjust, as I said, particularly this lot who's just 10th standards, who are. Coming into the military doing four years and then going out, that's a lot we need to focus on. Also there is an interesting issue here. Combat soldiers would also be those who are in operationally deployed areas. They would also be facing some kind of operational injuries or they could become battery casualties or they could be etc.
1659895102.0-1659928910.0
So again, do we have a system in place for Ugni views? If they were to get named or have disability due to operational reason, et cetera, how do we take care of that? So that is both for fatal casualties. People who get market are killed in action and as well as those who get disabled. Provisions have been made that they will be given a certain amount of disability amount or a pension amount in case he loses his life.
1659928980.0-1659947454.0
There is a specific amount for which he is not going to contribute anything. So those provisions actually have been made. So in terms of disability, in terms of payment of life insurance component, et cetera. So those aspects have been taken care of. One quick thing.
1659947512.0-1659971530.0
You mentioned the 10% into Cuaps. There is Central Armed Police Forces or CPOs. But that 10% is an existing so when we asked in fact some of us asked the Home Ministry is the 10% that they have announced in addition to the existing 10%. And the response was that no, this is not an additional 10%. It is the existing 10% which will still be enforced.
1659972350.0-1660019114.0
So cycles this is the unfortunate thing to say that requirements of military life and policing are different. Yes, they are different, I'm not saying they are different, but here you have a trained lot of people trained not only merely in handling of weapons etc. J, but who come with, you know, lot of discipline and ethos and respect for values. So somebody who's already been honed into such an environment for him to go into the police is not going to be so much. Yes, certain amount of retraining might be required but I think the basic characteristics of the kind of people that you need in a uniform force is there in the military.
1660019162.0-1660050280.0
And so I would again sort of urge that the Ministry of Home Affairs need to really look at this. After all, it's not a Ministry of Defense army, it's a national army and we need to make sure that this national army gets the best out of people and people who have served the country get an honorable job after they leave the service. I think it's a national sort of requirement and not something that only the Ministry of Defense needs to look at.
1660052410.0-1660099190.0
We have a few questions that have come in so I'm going to summarize and give you just see if we can cover as many as we can before time runs out. One is about. I think there's a lot of people have asked for some clarity on whether we can if we have to assume that 50,000 people are recruited into a deep path every year from this year and a certain portion of them, 10% of them, a certain portion of them are retained. Go into other paramilitary forces. How many do you think per year will then be out of the system entirely, which will then need a lot of skilling, a lot of certification programs to then join the civilian workforce.
1660099530.0-1660112490.0
There's one question about I think, Drew, you could look into this about whether we have some data on how many ex servicemen are employed in industries like the It industry.
1660115790.0-1660151030.0
There's also concern that a lot of the certificates given by the military aren't recognized by civilian institutions. There's a lot of, I think, administrative difficulties also in trying to implement this. My view is that we are looking at all the past data. If you're looking at the employment in the employment sector as a whole, that in itself is changing. And their constant earned learning and relearning is required.
1660151770.0-1660200360.0
Definitely one will have to because this is a learning age. It's not like they have become 35 or 40 and then they are getting into civilian life. We would need to give them specific training. And as far as this question of their certificate being not acceptable, things need to be changed because now industry, what industry is looking more for skill set rather than your qualification. So if you know about certain if you have certain skills, industry would welcome you any day, especially with all the Italians and the values that you are coming with, because that's what something is lacking in industry, and industry is looking for those.
1660203210.0-1660261294.0
In that sense, yes, we will have to look at all these different qualifications or experiences that army is giving to the individual, say, a physiotherapist of army or a medical person from working in the medical area or in Ahmed Corps, even as an on the ground fight. And Jaman who is fighting in the they are also trained for various things, various skill sets are developed. Now, all these areas would need to be considered if they I mean, the next thing is that they also should be made ready to learn new areas and unlearn and relearn new areas. And that's where the mindset change and specific effort will need to be made at the time of transition. Because in army also, things are changing very drastically.
1660261442.0-1660288674.0
New evolutions, new technology is coming. You have to learn. And therefore, many of the officials, even the Jamans who grow off the ranks, they are not able to qualify beyond a certain level, which has become easier in the last 1020 years. Previously, it was very, very difficult. So somewhere the dilution of army has also happened.
1660288872.0-1660343010.0
And that is probably this scheme is trying to better it. And at the same time, I do agree with Kundal that we will have to do, left in general, that we will have to make effort to train, make them compatible and get them employed because otherwise the interest in joining army would definitely get impacted. So we would because people would want to see that. Okay, if I'm spending these four years in ADME, I should have some privilege to get proper jobs in corporate or in the sector later. Okay, let me generally have a question from Palp Bagla.
1660343590.0-1660355910.0
This was also directed to you secret could Ugnipa contribute to homegrown gun culture and freedom to terrorism? If they will be highly trained their. Babies and if they have no jobs. Won'T it be a prescription for disaster?
1660358190.0-1660396866.0
So my own sense is the sphere has been expressed but I think it's a little overblown. Please. See, every year about 60,000 soldiers are retiring currently also from the military. I know you could say no, but these are people who are going with pension and therefore they are little more settled in life. But we haven't really come across many cases of these soldiers joining wrong organization or utilizing or misusing their training and their weapon handling capability, et cetera.
1660397058.0-1660428586.0
We really don't have. So I wouldn't think you would see a very large number of these people. I mean, there are always bad elements, but those are exceptions. But I don't think people who are who spent four years, who learned a little about sorry. Who learned a little about the military, he thought its values and if they are, as I said, we are able to settle.
1660428618.0-1660442500.0
A large majority of them into some honorable jobs after they leave the army. I don't think the danger of feeding into terrorism, et cetera, is going to emerge. I don't know what side could be.
1660448730.0-1660487106.0
Although we don't have any data as of now because most of the people we are speaking about bare minimum, they have spent for 16 years and most of them retire at the level of NCO, et cetera. And they retire with a certain degree of pension and sound security before they move into other drugs. In fact, today morning I was with them, constable To Hayana Police, who was about 16 years in a field artery regiment and I was discussing basically his point of view from his perspective. I think one thing is that when you reduce from 16 years to four years there will be certain new challenges that we really don't have any visibility in. So yes, there will be.
1660487208.0-1660518534.0
Second, as you said and I think you mentioned this when you were responding to this, the key will be what kind of jobs will they get. I think you pointed out that they are going to be 10th class and basically the education that they will give. And again, we keep talking about that somebody who served with an engineering regiment will be better skilled or somebody with EME battalion will be better skilled. But how many of them will be from those specialized units? The bulk will be from the fighting arm and most of them will be from the infantry.
1660518662.0-1660562218.0
So their skilling, if you are going to say that security is the only job having worked in security is one reason why we are able to take a lot of ex servicemen insecurity is because there is a certain cost factor to it and because they already have pensions and some kind of health services, etcetera. Already assured for them. They agreed to come and do their job for an X amount of money. Any company, if it has to hire a fresh person, say 21 years of age, who have different aspirations, doesn't have pension, doesn't have the health benefits, the cost factor will go up. As a company I would have to think twice or twice to see whether I can even employ these kind of people in security jobs per se.
1660562384.0-1660605400.0
As far as the upskilling is concerned, again, I would be worried about how much as a company do I have to spend because any way companies are struggling in current LNGs to upskill their existing workforce, do I take on a due burden from a financial point of view? And third, to answer, I don't think there is joy, wrong organization, et cetera. But if you have persons who are trained in combat or trained to kill, pulmo, weapon handling better, et cetera, and if they are not channelized very quickly into productive jobs and we have seen study after study over militarization of any society has not really led to a very good outcome. So yes, in our context we'll have to look at some of those.
1660609230.0-1660641746.0
Well, I should put this up in general and if you can see it his father buglar again, he says that he disagrees with you about Niwi's being let us stray. He says the fight inside the Golden Temperature during Operation Blue Star was led by an ex Indian army officer and we have seen how much damage they could inflict. So there are lots of concerns about it. No. So as I said, there are exceptions and there are cases like this.
1660641928.0-1660684798.0
But if we are pointing out to what happened inside the Golden Temple, please look, Jammu and Kashmir is a state where there is fairly active terrorism and counter insurgency going on. There are thousands and thousands of Kashmiris who are serving in the army, in the territorial army units, in the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, in the Jammu and Kashmir Rifle. I mean, how many of them after retirement have we have cases of these people joining some terrorist organization? And the answer is Nil almost nail. So therefore, I think, yes, there could be some sort of bad hat.
1660684894.0-1660734820.0
But largely our experience shows that people who served in the army are not really going and sort of joining some wrong organization. As Psychic pointed out, the four year lot is different, slightly different in that sense. But again, I wouldn't sort of overplay this danger and say, look, I think these guys will go and join these sort of terrorist organizations. You pointed out examples of foreign militaries and foreign armies and there again people who are serving for short period. Are we seeing some examples of people who've done the short service and the military actually a large number is going in and joining some violent organization and I think the answer will be.
1660736710.0-1660751686.0
Okay, the clock is taking down. We have less than six minutes left. So I'm just going to ask for final comments we can explain. Yeah, okay. Do you have something you want to bring up second, another question.
1660751868.0-1660781150.0
I was going to ask a final question but if something before that go. Ahead if you can extend I think we have the safety module but okay. Coming back to our operational thing, there are some very interesting questions which have come out that would there be lots of benefits to youngsters if they are in a network with mentors and peers from the armed forces after doing four years of service? So do you think that would be a benefit?
1660784770.0-1660812540.0
When I'm saying the army, I mean all three services. The army takes a great pride in looking after people who have left the service, whom we call veterans or somebody calls ex servicemen. There is great pride that we are able to look after them. We are able to do whatever we want for them. I think as far as the agnivirs are concerned, yes, the army will try and do whatever they can.
1660813150.0-1660857094.0
But I think really the onus for resettlement lies on the government. It cannot be done by the military. So our whole concept of looking after our veterans is look after their welfare, make sure they don't have any problems in case there are some issues, make sure the family, et cetera is looked after. So it's a welfare oriented kind of system. When we look at our ex service, what we are looking at is the Avenue AIDS is going to be a career progression oriented and I think that while yes, the army will do, the military will do what it can, I think the large onus lies on the government.
1660857292.0-1660871840.0
And I did say on the corporate side today a lot of corporates are saying we will absorb the ugly. Let us see after four years I hope that comes true because that is going to be a major sort of game changer. As far as the whole ugly system is.
1660873970.0-1660912410.0
I would say that instead of army mentors, I would say they're now in the corporate world. It is more of coach and mentors at every level that are coming. So we would need people the corporate needs to develop this mentoring program to get the transition done of the umbrellas to corporate life. So you're saying they should have a separate budget ready to do this with. One of the major problem with the corporates is that they are not getting skilled people and that's the reason the budget and everything is going beyond.
1660912990.0-1660953394.0
And if you look at our engineering colleges graduates, 85% of them are not employable. So whole new industry is getting developed in the market which is on employability of people. Those kind of initiatives will also be required by these 10th class and 12th class army people who are getting out. Whole new industry is getting settled around skill development. So all these other new areas where the corporate's main problem of not getting skilled people who are employable is getting solved.
1660953442.0-1660983646.0
And that would benefit people coming out of RW. Okay? Because here we are discussing that where will this budget come from? So ideally then the budget should go to the corporate sector where they have a budget for agnews to start obscuring them, right? It would be both government and corporate because the interest of the corporate is there and the government would need to show their support, not the show really do the support to the people who are moving through the path of army.
1660983678.0-1661030170.0
Because army needs attractive more support and we need people to be interested to join Arme, right? Because the point is that for example, many jobs would be there in four engineering industries or in manufacturing. But a 10th class boy who has only got combat skills, that he knows how to handle a weapon, et cetera. And majority of the Abniwees will be these kind of boys who gives them the training so that they again and who bears the cost of the training so that they can be part of the core engineering or manufactured engines. Yeah, so the whole new industry is getting set up, definitely government needs to that six months or one year kind of a support that I'm saying is required around that itself.
1661030340.0-1661071790.0
And whether government sponsors them for these institutes, these universities or does it within the army set up, that's all one has to take. Which also brings me, you must have seen CMI figures and generally figures that are coming out. Unemployment is at unprecedented levels right now. So already there is a dearth of jobs. So if you are going to have a whole bunch of people coming out with certain kind of combat skills, et cetera, and we already have very high unemployment where existing youngsters workforce are not able to find jobs, where will these new jobs come from for the restroom?
1661072210.0-1661098200.0
That's a generic problem of unemployability. I agree. But that problem is how do we then address that problem where unemployment continues to rise and yet we are hoping to find jobs for these young. See, the civil student is not getting any specific support from the government. I mean, I'm saying when if the government support and other things are they are likely to be doing better in those kind of job itself.
1661098650.0-1661131534.0
Because if they are getting support, the age group is the same in which they are struggling to get the job. So the competition, definitely they have to be ready to face the competition. But the benefit of people coming to the army channel is that one, they have got army training. The second they are also getting this should also be getting the support for government, for being employable afterwards, also become employable afterwards. I have this question for you.
1661131572.0-1661168390.0
Let's say you've been in HR for so long, you are now also looking at recruitment in a hypothetical situation. You have an ugly weed with four years of combat, military combat experience and you have a BTech student who's come to you from not a very high well known college, but say a second or third care college and you have these two candidates and you are hiring for a manufacturing industry. Who would you give preference to? I would look at the skill sets. These are the skill sets, the VTEX, two room and somebody who trained in combat.
1661168550.0-1661178782.0
Which person would you hire? These are the two skills that are there. The combat is gone. No, that's what I'm saying. Let's say that is the skill set that is there.
1661178836.0-1661215980.0
That is an advantage anyway, this thing. But when we are talking about somebody coming from a BTech, this kind of a thing, after that, after the combat experience, if they are given specific training, if they are qualified, they'll be given specific telling to the engineering from the engineering sector of army. No, we are not looking at that because we don't have visibility into who will give that upskilling. We are just asking as we understand it now with only combat skills is available and a BTech student is available. Just that, nothing more.
1661218270.0-1661243300.0
Again, now most of the organizations are coming up with testing the skill set, whether they are coming from a B grade engineering college, if they don't know anything, they are not acceptable. So the thing is, if the army person is coming from the army background and knows about injuring, they will be preferred. That's the thing.
1661245350.0-1661249400.0
Sorry, we cannot hear you.
1661266800.0-1661275890.0
Tania. We can't hear you. See, the mindset is changing. It will take time. I mean definitely it will take time and there has to be a concerted effort towards it.
1661276420.0-1661305340.0
It cannot be totally changed in two years or four years, kind of a duration, definitely. So I think because our main moderators, we are probably having some communication issues. So I'll try and step in and it's been an absolute pleasure always, sir to speak to you and learn from you and hear your thoughts. So that was very valuable for us. Dr.
1661305410.0-1661369084.0
Singh, again, thank you for bringing us a different perspective to this whole discussion. And I think that's a discussion that we'll have to continue having because there will be major issues that we'll have to look after. And as sir pointed out, these are going to be our boys and our youngsters who will be coming out and after four years of certain degree of experience, et cetera, and looking after them will be very important, not only from ensuring a good career from them, but also from a morale point of view of the military. Also what remains to be seen, as sir again pointed out that the actual impact of this scheme will start showing up three to four years later when we are looking at the operational part of things. And there again, we'll have a lot of issues because can majority of Agnews with a short tenure be able to do the kind of operational work that a soldier with 1516 years of experience and a career path like that will be able to do and the impact it will have on infantry and extra regimental employment like last year?
1661369122.0-1661381428.0
I thoughts, et cetera. So it's been a fascinating discussion. We still have a lot of answers and hopefully we'll have more. Just a few quick words about pulkay the platform. It's a new platform.
1661381514.0-1661406924.0
It's completely unlike other platforms, indian designed, Indian funded, Indiancreated and hopefully we'll see more and more people. We've just opened up the platform to a whole lot of people. So we'll request you to continue to have more conversations on this platform and we look forward to much deeper engagement with all of you in the coming days. So thank you very much and good evening to all of you. Thank you.
1661406962.0-1661414344.0
Sake thank you. Saga. Thank you, Tanya. Thank you. It's really privileged to be there with you gently.
1661414392.0-1661415770.0
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you.

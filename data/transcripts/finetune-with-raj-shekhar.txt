No problem. Before you joined the audience that has just joined I was just telling them that we are so in love with the work that you do. Rather the words that you write. I've always been somebody who's passionate about songwriting. Not that I can do that, but I just love lyrics.

For me, words and lyrics need the music. So you have such a huge contribution in Roli. The good and the bad times are there for all of us. But how sometimes Hindi film songs or just songs in general, you know, take us through those times and you know, they become a companion. So thank you so much for giving us those beautiful songs that we.

One of the most iconic albums but we have seen in the last ten to 15 years and I think you understand them very well somehow. I don't know your life experience, hair observation, of course, talent, young married couple of the new love and the use of the word kaser is so beautifully put there. And cut to the new. Make a song like Rathi Rati, which I think is like for our generation, for this, like I said, 1015 years. It's like the defining breakup song.

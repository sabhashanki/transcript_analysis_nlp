1654358570.0-1654385030.0
A very good afternoon to you. Rajivan good afternoon. Good afternoon to you. Welcome to a very new platform of conversation, hulk, a made in India made for the world social media platform. A platform where conversations happen to empower India democracy.
1654386970.0-1654436278.0
This show, called towards a New India, is all about a discussion on how science, technology, environment and health will play a role in the making of a new India. As we go forward in the Amritkar today's discussion is all about something every one of us is deeply associated with monsoons and rain. How robust is India's monsoon forecasting? And to give us some perspective, we have one of India's most well known monsoon forecasters, Dr. M.
1654436364.0-1654460640.0
Rajivan. Dr. Rajivan was Earth scientist and then he became the secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences. And I have worked on reporting the monsoon with him for now, well over 25 years, some can say probably as old as the monsoon, probably not.
1654462690.0-1654476900.0
Welcome to the program, Dr. Rajivan. It's so nice of you to give us time on this very new platform and so nice of you to go through the login procedure for this. Thank you. Thank you.
1654478470.0-1654499542.0
You are sitting in Kerala. The monsoon has already hit Kerala. I am sitting in a sultry, warm deli where it is still baking. How does the monsoon season and what is the forecast for this year's monsoon, Dr. Rajivan?
1654499686.0-1654549578.0
Yeah, good afternoon to all of you and I'm extremely happy to participate in this new platform. And thank you, Palo, for inviting me. And the question regarding the ensuring monsoon season, we have a good news from IMD. As per the long range forecast season forecast of IMD, we'll have a good manSource this year the forecast was 99, which was upgraded to now 103 percentage of long term upgrade. It's really a good news and because the main condition for main criteria, which IMD has given a good manson for cost is basically the prevalence of Lalina conditions of Pacific with the Alina conditions prevailing and with other no more adverse conditions elsewhere, we should expect a normal month this year.
1654549744.0-1654569230.0
So it's a good news for all of us. Certainly everybody expects that every year, year after year, you and your client, when you were at the India Metrological Department, then at the Ministry of Earth Sciences, people only want to hear good news that it will be a good monsoon.
1654571510.0-1654593400.0
How difficult or easy is it, Dr. Rajivan, to try and make a forecast which is so far ahead? It's a long range forecast, three months, almost ahead of time. You are trying to predict of what is really a chaotic tropical condition. Yeah, that's a good question.
1654594970.0-1654621418.0
Simple answer or quick answer? Is it's very difficult and still IMD does it? IMD has been doing it since 1886. They started and based on some empirical relationships, et cetera, that practice has been going on. But I will tell you that seasonal prediction first of all seasonal prediction, not only on monsoon or any other parameter anywhere else, is a tough proposition because as you correctly said, no sir is averting.
1654621514.0-1654672734.0
So if you cannot make a very deterministic forecast beyond tropics, beyond about one week or so and middle attitudes probably came up to ten days. So the question is then how you predict seasonal time scale forecast and seasonal time scale? The answer is because there are some slowly varying conditions like from ocean for example, biosphere, et cetera, very slowly. So if we really monitor how these ocean conditions are behaving, and we will be able to get a kind of intelligent information how Manson could be and Manson is influenced by large scale patterns from ocean and theosphere, et cetera, that we have evidence in terms of observations, in terms of modeling efforts, et cetera. We know if these conditions are prevailing, that can be good, of course.
1654672772.0-1654704410.0
Still we need to improve our understanding that we are doing it simultaneously. The meantime, we can want to predict. There are two ways. One is the actual methods which MD has been following it for years together. What we do is for example, if you want to predict in May, what we do is we take predictates from the earlier months, even up to May for example, then assume that using old historical data, the parameters are derived from data for some parameter behaves this way, then it will be indicating points of months.
1654704480.0-1654721502.0
It will be good. So then you develop kind of equations and try to develop it. Then what happened in statistical methods we don't know what is happening within the season. We are not able to account it. The forecast is stopped, there more.
1654721556.0-1654764586.0
Further information is taken into statistical method. Whereas the dynamical methods we know very well that models can really find out the feedback process within that within the four month season and kind of any other systems, for example, how they interact with but still, dynamical models also have their own problem. So in summary, the Manson petition is a tough proposition. Still we keep doing good work with the man's own forecast and research and we don't want to stop it because there's a demand from government as well as other agencies for this. We will keep continuing, but simply as well we will try to improve the forecast.
1654764618.0-1654771390.0
We are improving our we have making another efforts to improve the monthly. But it's a tough proposition.
1654774070.0-1654824350.0
In fact, not only tough, you do it with accountability. Because people in India expect that like for Delhi on 1 July, like a tap, the water will turn on the skies in Delhi, when you were in Utens Delhi, that was the expectation. When there is so much variability, so much chaos. How well do we understand you said IMD has been predicting for the last over 200 years and monitoring the monsoon. How well do we understand the physics and the atmospheric conditions and ocean conditions which lead to the formation of the monsoon.
1654825090.0-1654840818.0
The formation of monsoon we understand very well. Maybe last year, 30, 40 years, our understanding has improved substantially. Thanks to observation, thanks to modeling efforts. We know how what is monsoon, how it comes and et cetera. And of course, there are still unknowns.
1654840914.0-1654863630.0
I'm not saying that we know everything. But our understanding has improved. Especially where Manson is coming, how the Manson is varying from year to year or even the other variability. We know well far better than what we have knowledge. Our understanding is far better now.
1654863780.0-1654877614.0
So the question is how we use this information, our knowledge in terms of prediction. That's the question. Finally speaking, even though prediction, I say it's a difficult proposition. But we have improved a lot. We have improved understanding.
1654877662.0-1654884610.0
We have very carefully, very intelligently used it for improving our model. As far as monsoon.
1654886650.0-1654899770.0
In so many years. Let's look at where we have data. Has the monsoon ever failed and gone to zero? Or has it always come? And what is the level which it always comes?
1654899840.0-1654912542.0
Because the monsoon in my living memory. Has never failed me. It has always come in your life. If you want to believe the month you believe in Mansour, it will come. It will come.
1654912596.0-1654922122.0
It will never fail you. You can really trust Mansour. It's a natural process. It's a natural physical process which is happening. And it will give some rain.
1654922186.0-1654942920.0
Okay? Definitely it will give rain. So I remember the minimum rainfall that we can expertise around 730 or 70% of monsoon rain. Almost a 68 percentage or so. That's what I remember exactly.
1654943370.0-1654963230.0
I don't remember exactly, but that's the amount of rainfall which we had that route, 1918 or so. Then question is then some years it comes with the more rain. For some years it's less rainfall. But now monsoon never fails everything it may answer, maybe it's slightly delayed, it may come too late. It may go early.
1654963380.0-1654966640.0
If it thinks I want to go early, then it will go early.
1654968930.0-1654988614.0
But it comes. But that is heartening news that we have always got at least 70% rain. So so that way I think India as a country should be highly indebted to the monsoon. That it never fails us. Yeah, that's true.
1654988652.0-1655001734.0
But 70 percentage is 30%. Deficiency is a large number. Frankly speaking. Even though we may say that 70 percentage at least we are getting. But 30% deficiencies really lead to big drought.
1655001862.0-1655007050.0
And many places in many regions can be under severe droughts.
1655009310.0-1655032546.0
And because the year to where the so called weak or standard deviation is about 10% age, anything below 10% is not that good. But still some areas still we can get normal monsoon. But 30% we should not expect that we will get only 70% every year. Then your life is miserable. And that is why they say the.
1655032568.0-1655057254.0
Monsoon India's economy is a gamble on the monsoon. And the monsoon is the real Finance Minister and probably more powerful than Mrs. Nirmala Sitaraman. And what would you have to say to that now? I still believe it was a statement by earlier our honorable past president Pranab Mukherjee savior stood in the Finance Minister.
1655057302.0-1655087846.0
He told in the parliament that one son is the Finance Minister. It is true. Still it is one son is the Finance Minister. Even though the dependence of agriculture on Indian GDP has reduced maybe some 30, 40%, but still because Manson manson influences many sectors, not really agriculture. Now, Manson is really an important parameter for India and government is very much sure.
1655087868.0-1655089510.0
Read about the performance supplements.
1655093050.0-1655123242.0
In my own years of reporting. The years which cause most worry are the years where there is a deficiency in rainfall and there is a drought. In your memory, in the last 50 years, how many droughts have the India Metrological Department predicted and accurately predicted? Well, that's a very interesting question. I think, frankly speaking, our track record in predicting route is very poor, frankly speaking.
1655123396.0-1655145874.0
And 2015 was a very successful forecast, so we should appreciate that. And even 14 it was almost very marginal drought. But then we indicated the forecast was 92 or 93. It was very close to actually. So we did not specifically say that it will be a drought, but 2015 we said drought.
1655146002.0-1655179202.0
And in the past, when I really see the history of old forecast, 1960s all, there are one or two occasions there were one or two occasions these models were indicating the parameters, indicating a dropout. But government of India never told people that it is going to be a drought because it was never published. It was never published. And of course it's not a secret document now it's all available data available. So that's why I'm very confidently am telling only one forecast which we said drought was in 2015.
1655179256.0-1655197274.0
Now, draft card is not that good in drought prediction. Even though there are recent years, we are trying to indicate that there could be a possibility. That's why we are giving probability. In terms of 2009 also we had some indications. Our understanding of a drought phenomena has improved a lot.
1655197392.0-1655206940.0
So even though models may not exactly hit on the bull side, but we give some kind of indication that there could be a chance of.
1655209410.0-1655240306.0
For a person who reports science and technology, I find it very creditable that at least accountably the Ministry of Earth Sciences forecasts the monsoon and also at the end of the season owns up. That yes, we got it wrong. Or we got it right. So it's not easy. You mentioned about the statistical methods, but now you also have the more powerful computers.
1655240498.0-1655280178.0
Tell me a little bit about the monsoon mission, because that has been a major trust one when you were there at the helm, as at IMD and then at the ministry of Earth Sciences. And how have these supercomputers and the most powerful supercomputers in India exist? With the monsoon mission. Yeah, monsoon Mission was launched in fact in 2012, with the ultimate aims to improve in monsoon in all time scales study from short range, medium range, including a four seasonal forecast. But till then, our technology, our capability was not that good.
1655280344.0-1655319902.0
Of course, seasonal forecast we have been doing with statistical models and short range forecasts we have been doing with very close resolution, numerical resolution models, et cetera. So Monsoon Mission was kind of heartbreaking, kind of a mission for the government of India. They gave a lot of money and we could really wanted to adopt a new, far better high resolution, better models and set of models you need big computers we cannot run. And so investments in monsoon prediction was started in twelve and really it gave a lot of good results. So we could buy a big computer and we could run.
1655319956.0-1655375110.0
Now we are able to run models with 12 mainly because of course we have capability, we have good scientists in our moist institutions, right people. But at the same time, if we don't have so we purchased computers and after 2012, then when I took over a second year, we purchased it. But now I understand that they are procuring still for better computer now. So computer supercomputers are part of monsoon tradition problem it's unless we have very fast computers, we're not able to do our job because dynamic models are really worth of trying it and it's especially for shortened forecast. Extended forecast is well proven even in dynamic, even for seasonal forecast, dynamical models give you some kind of engravement, some kind of satisfaction.
1655375290.0-1655388070.0
So we should work pursuing it and try to improve the dynamical models. We have few gray areas where we have to tap it and improve the model. And so computers and all this infrastructure.
1655390250.0-1655435454.0
Satellites, satellites have also come into a big way in India. Really, if we really talk about short range forecast, IMD short range forecast have improved substantially for last ten years or beautiful forecast. Now, if you really see the analysis of our data we have is that we have improved at least by two days of skill to have a good skill forecast up to three days now, which has been improved to five days now. So up to five days in advance we can give good cost and you can see the example of you could see the example of filing and so many cyclones we could predict almost by six days in advance. So shorten focus is improved mainly because there are many factors.
1655435502.0-1655478702.0
Of course, the only computer we have adapted to better models and another important parameter is data. And data means most of satellite data is now we are able to accumulate assimilate into the models. We have our own satellites, plus we get, thanks to WMO collaboration, we get all other satellites, even from China, we get out there satellite data to us without making any politics out of it and Japan data and European Weather Agency, US weather and Nova data, all data we get. So sadly, if you put 100 data into the model, 90 data comes from satellites. So that percentage of 90% of data which go into the model satellites plays a very important role.
1655478846.0-1655515834.0
And so we need to really invest more and more on methodological satellites which can give you parameters which can be explicit to the models. Beyond this, how much of this monsoon forecasting is still human skill? I remember the days when you had people would go out and listen to the pied crested cuckoo or do something like that. Do you still have human skill involved and human intelligence in monsoon forecasting? Or is it all dependent on mathematical models?
1655515962.0-1655532180.0
No, human skill is very much required. Very much required. It's almost like a doctor treating a patient. He may be MBBS, but he may have 25 years of treating he must have seen thousands of patients with same type of problem. So his diagnostic will be far better.
1655533590.0-1655580420.0
But other person who's just coming out from college with the MD and all these things, but he must not see the patient similarly IMD. I used to be a forecaster for short rain, then cyclone forecaster, then moved to climate services, then our personal knowledge will always add to it, but it cannot replace the models. Definitely cannot replace, but definitely our knowledge, our personal knowledge, our experience can be added to the forecast which are coming out from the models and it's almost very value added information. And the question is, right interpretation of model forecast is very important. Otherwise, if you don't have an experience, if you don't have a knowledge, you can interpret it in many ways.
1655580950.0-1655605738.0
So raw output is in any country, raw model outputs are not given to the public, it cannot be given. You need to give additional flavor in terms of your knowledge or some kind of statutical, post processing, et cetera. Then only the right information can come out and it can be given to the people. Otherwise, raw model output now what happened is raw model outputs are available everywhere in the country. It's a freely available website.
1655605824.0-1655648806.0
People download it, interpret it in their own way like a blind man interpret an elephant. They interpret it anyway and issue their own forecast. Any forecast, human interpretation, experience forecast is the so IMT's importance, is there? No, I remember there was once I think you mentioned I remember somebody mentioned that there are 1.3 billion monsoon forecasters in India. The same way as everyone is a doctor at home, everybody forecasts one way or the other, looks at the sky and tries to make an understanding of the weather just to update the audience.
1655648918.0-1655675310.0
There's a very interesting anecdote I have about Dr. Rajivan and which will tell you about the human intelligence and skill. And this relates to India's first mission to the mode. And I hope, Rajivan, you remember that it was a very rainy day when India wanted to launch its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle up into the sky to go towards the moon. I was there at Sharikota.
1655675810.0-1655700742.0
I was standing in needy, almost knee water. It had so much rain. Then early morning, when the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle was to be launched, it was almost scrubbed. But then Dr. Rajivan was the weatherman on duty at Siyarikota and he found a hole above the Shiharikota Island and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle was pumped through that hole.
1655700806.0-1655724306.0
And then rest is history when we found water molecules on the surface of the moon. So our monsoon man also contributed to finding water molecules on the moon. Is that a good feeling you have, Dr. Rajivan? Yeah, it was really a good feeling from me.
1655724328.0-1655737890.0
I still remember those days. It was a couple of months after I joined the ISRO from my MD. And it was the first experience of rocket lazari the satellite launch, and said it was raining.
1655740950.0-1655758646.0
So people were trying to stop that launch because of heavy rains. Then I also asked them my question. Now question is we are going to get rain, heavy rains. And they said that rains are not an issue for rocket launching. The issue is thunderstorms, lighting, et cetera.
1655758758.0-1655778878.0
I said once Manson is setting, this is a northeast Manson, nothing but northeast Manson. Once Manson said saying, I vouch you that there will be no thunderstorm, arguably. So that gave a lot of confidence to the people. And there's a lot of Daniel variation in C R because of a C please land and CPR. And early morning normally safe recorder doesn't get much faith.
1655778974.0-1655810860.0
So that information also it was large in the early morning. So that information was also very useful. So that's the way your personal knowledge XP give you some kind of additional information. Otherwise, from the model, it's very difficult to interpret and tell you information which can be used for taking a good decision. So this is a good example how personal information, personal knowledge can really humble, but I am very humbled and normally don't speak it out.
1655812750.0-1655839000.0
It was a fascinating experience. Dr. Rajivan and that brings into the core of the issue that human intelligence is still very important in India's. Monsoon Forecasting dr. Raheevan, there is a question which has come from Vijay, who's asking now we are seeing some private monsoon forecasting happening not just through the India Weather Office or the India Met Office.
1655839530.0-1655867786.0
Is that something which is going to grow? Is that something which will make a competition between the government agency and the private agency? Now, I am no more Secretary MOA, so I can speak little with more freedom. And frankly speaking, private players should be engaged in this country. Private players should come and empty cannot do all the things what people expect, the requirement, the so called the requirement.
1655867898.0-1655892438.0
So a private place only. For example, in the US. The weather forecast are prepared whether the models are done by US weather Agency, us national Weather Services but the dissemination to the usage are done all by private place. All by private place. There are hundreds of private place who do a good job, but they bang on the US agencies, other forecasts and they put they add more values to that.
1655892524.0-1655915082.0
And also they make custom made, tailor made a kind of forecast for different usage depending upon what is their need and they give it to them. But I will tell you this. Private players are not any person who doesn't know any knowledge. These players are certified people. These private players are certified by American Metrological Society.
1655915226.0-1655928946.0
And these private players are well trained in the US university. They have PhDs in metrology. Okay? So any Thompson Cherries cannot really start a private agency in US. But in India anybody can start.
1655929048.0-1655951754.0
Anybody on the road, on the below the road, anybody can issue a forecast because data are available for cars, data are available. And so while encouraging private industry, it should be based on good scientific support, good intellectual support. Otherwise I said that with all human beings we have a doctor and they have metrology. So anybody can issue a full course. Okay?
1655951872.0-1655969230.0
And in India we have I should really confess that we have a tendency of private place. Private place industries will do better job than government. Let's have a feeling, oh, they are private place. They should be better than IMD, but which may not be true. Which is not true.
1655969380.0-1655989430.0
And so I humble submission to all private places. Let them come, let them have their own way of doing it, but they should be transparent what they are doing. As you correctly said that IMD comes with the forecast and they verify it. And IMD's models are peer reviewed and publishing journals. Anybody can read what we are doing.
1655989500.0-1656012000.0
There's no hidden agenda in our forecast. And when we forecast come, the season over, gets over, we issue kind of a verification report. We know what is bad and what is not correct and we take the responsibility of that. We take the responsibility of when the forecast goes bad, we don't say that it was somebody's healthy. So accountability is very important.
1656012610.0-1656041554.0
And you know, in IMT and private place there's a big difference even in your focus is not a child's play. It is really you need a huge infrastructure from end to end, focus generation, getting data, getting it together. You run it in you have a state of our models, you run it in supercomputed interpretation, then make it into different user sector forecast, then disseminate it, then verified. It's a huge process. It's really an industry.
1656041602.0-1656076034.0
It's basically an industry. And anybody who just opens up a computer and sits in a corner anywhere and say that this is my forecast and I will compete with IMD. I don't have an answer. I also believe and most of the time I've seen these private players will come out with the forecast a couple of days ahead of the official forecast and then try and take the wind out of the official forecast. We are also sitting at a time when there is a certain global warming and a climate change happening.
1656076232.0-1656120202.0
Is the monsoon getting affected by the changing climate, Dr. Rajiva? Definitely climate change is really affecting monsoon definitely. There are already evidences are there saying that for some heavy rainfall frequency is increasing price bill, the length of the price spell is increasing. So we have seen already some kind of evidence saying that Manson is being impacted by climate change and future climate change projections from IPCC models also show that again the impact of climate change, future climate change also will be the religion especially of course monsoon will be very good news I want to share is that monsoon will be robust.
1656120266.0-1656157398.0
We'll still have good Manson and only thing the variability can be very much different. So one year can be very large out another year it can be large flood, et cetera, and the frequency of heavy rainfall likely to be more in the coming year. So we should be fully prepared for kind of events like flash flood et cetera. Urban floods for example, urban floods frequency can really increase and also the dry spells, the number of rainy days will reduce but once your dry spell starts it will prolong. So this all will have a serious implication for us, especially for agriculture and also water resources management.
1656157494.0-1656180100.0
People should know both doing agriculture as well as water sources this kind of changes. So we should be able to tell this usage that this climate is changing and it's already impacted monsoon and future also this kind of changes can be expected so we should be careful and they should be fully prepared. So adaptability is very important, people should adapt to the future.
1656182710.0-1656240102.0
Thanks a lot Dr. Rajivan for giving us very nice information on monsoon, how you go about forecasting the monsoon, how the monsoon mission has helped in getting better dynamical forecast. And if you ask me, the best piece of news you gave me was towards the end when you said that the monsoon even during a changing climate will remain robust and India would still get monsoon rains. The variability may be there so we have to better manage both our agriculture and water resources but at least they will be rains because managing when there is water is much easier than trying to manage when there is no water or there is a complete drought. It's always a pleasure to speak to you, Dr.
1656240156.0-1656279010.0
Rajivan, and to be able to speak to you on a platform which is made in India, where everything, the data remains in India. And a platform, Hulk, which is made for the world, is certainly satisfying because, like the monsoon, this platform is also directly going to affect India in times to come. Thanks a lot for speaking to us, Dr. Rajivan. Thank you if you permit that just 1 minute I will take, if you don't mind regarding the encouragement to the private place.
1656279080.0-1656297526.0
So when I was secretary, we started a program to make the start up with a startup. So we will give our data, we'll give our forecast. We want to encourage private players to come up and help IMD. And so we will. Soon IMD will come sorry, MoS will come out with a program of inviting startup from the private place.
1656297628.0-1656321558.0
We'll give money to them, we'll give the data to them and they should help IMD to improve again, forecast. Also dissemination of the forecast for different sectors. So IMD and administrative air science is open to the private place. Thank you.

Now with the deployment of startups in space, the deployment of startups in drones, the deployment of startups in computer and information technology where all of these come together and if the monsoon behaves just the way Dr. Rajivan wants it to behave, it would be a wonderful feeling for the country. Thank you always a delight for speaking to the person who not only forecasts or was at the helm of forecasting the monsoon for India but also played a critical role in finding water on the pars surface of the moon. Thanks a lot, Dr. Rajuan.

{"summary": "Vivek Madan, Vishnu Narayan and Falguni Rao talk about the Drama Library. The Drama Library is a digital library of unpublished plays. It was created to provide access between The Drama Library allows greater, more transparent access for people who want to do more work. The Drama Library is the first project and we've got a couple more on the pipeline. The Drama Library has about 250 plays now recently. We have place in multiple languages, including Hindi, English, some in Canada, there's some stuff in Gujarati, lots in Marathi. And we All you need to do is fill up a small form with the details about your play and you upload your script. So you can be sitting anywhere in the world. It's easy to access, not just for readers The primary concern for this entire workflow design and this user experience design is to keep it uncomplicated clutter free. The primary concern was to sort of give us stress free reading experience. So yeah, it is the digital experience of what a physical library would give you like a quiet, stress Karthik: We originally started out as being a library of unpublished plays, and we still are that. When we started reaching out to playwrights friends and other acquaintances or people we didn't know, a lot of them sent their published place. So we In a month or so we should be rolling out our Contact, the Playwright feature. This is essentially going to allow you, as a reader, if you read a play and you Playwright does not hold the authority to award copyright for production or for use of that play. New writers often get railroaded, as you The focus of the library in its second iteration is going to be on the next play. So if you're a playwright, when do you upload your next play? When do you write your next Bosha Center is looking at other ways like apart from the library. Other offerings, other digital offerings, which are going to be for various other things. For the moment, I think we're just going to keep it free for everyone. It was never going to be a huge revenue stream for us in any case.

The next day we have a conversation with the playwright themselves. Kanchan Bhattachari: I was a little worried when I heard about this as to does this mean curation?

So the idea with places like that is to actually go and do writing workshops there. Kanshan: We hold these conversations and readings on the last weekend of every month. We announced it on our social media like before every reading. People can follow us on Instagram Vic: I had a similar idea many years ago about something like this. Of course I was too lazy and I never got around to doing anything about it. But I did hear and talk to a lot of talk to playwrights in Rajasthan and in many smaller towns of up who are not really computer savvy or The advantage of being the rare case of a crossover between technology and art is that I can confidently say any deadline, which is ridiculous and no one's going to question me. One unique advantage of working in tech, of course, is that when a project of this nature comes in, then the ability to like sort I think that the best is yet to come.

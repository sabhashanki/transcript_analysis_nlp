{"summary": "This show, called towards a New India, is all about a discussion on how science, technology, environment and health will play a role in the making of a new India. How robust is India's monsoon forecasting? And IMD has been doing it since 1886. They started and based on some empirical relationships, et cetera, that practice has been going on. Still we need to improve our understanding that we are doing it simultaneously. The formation of monsoon we understand very well. Maybe last year, 30, 40 years, our understanding The minimum rainfall that we can expertise around 730 or 70% of monsoon rain. India as a country should be highly indebted In your memory, in the last 50 years, how many droughts have the India Metrological Department predicted and accurately predicted? Well, that's a very interesting question. I think, frankly The monsoon mission was launched in 2012, with the ultimate aims to improve in monsoon in all time scales. But till then, our technology, our capability was not that good. Now we are able to run models with 12 mainly because of course we have capability. Human skill is very much required. It's almost like a doctor treating a patient. He may be MBBS, but he may have 25 years of treating he must have seen thousands of patients with same type of problem. Dr. Rajivan was the weatherman on duty at Siyarikota. He found a hole above the Shiharikota Island and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle was pumped through that In India we have a tendency of private place. Private place industries will do better job than government. But I humble submission to all private places. IMD comes with the forecast and they verify it. IMD's models are peer reviewed and publishing journals. There's no hidden agenda in our forecast. We take the responsibility of when the forecast goes bad. Dr. Rajivan: Monsoon even during a changing climate will remain robust and India would still get monsoon rains. The variability may be there so we have to better manage both our agriculture and water resources."}

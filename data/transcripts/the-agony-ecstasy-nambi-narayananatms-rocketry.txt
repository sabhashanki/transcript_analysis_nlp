Welcome to Kulke, a conversation platform made in India for the world. Truly an Arthur Nehrubha effort. And most social media platforms are either American or Chinese. This is Indian and that is what makes it so special. On this show towards a new India we are discussing an old topic which has come back to us.
1657219452.0-1657240848.0
And we have with us a very special person today. Good to see you. Nambin Narayanan. Sir. Not in the theater, but in person today online, Mr.
1657241014.0-1657274728.0
Nambi Narayanan is the real hero on whom the biopic rocketry, the numbi effect has been made by our Madhuan. Very rarely does Bollywood make biopics on Indian engineers and scientists. Mr. Nambin Ariana is very special. Every rocket in India which goes up has his signature on it.
1657274894.0-1657307712.0
Be it the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, be it the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, be it Mangalyan Chandrayan or other missions. But his life took a turn. At some point we will discuss all about and I must say the film rocketry which I have seen is a great movie. So all in the audience, please go out and see it. It's a very well made film.
1657307856.0-1657320984.0
And from Nambi sir, we will get to know more details about it. Thanks a lot. Numb. Naranan sir, you are a busy man. You have too many requirements and full things to be done.
1657321102.0-1657332620.0
But so nice of you to join me. And I also apologize to the audience for starting a bit late. Sometimes it issues can be more troublesome than launching rockets.
1657338580.0-1657365328.0
The film rocketry, the numbie effect is based on your life. How close to real life is the real hero Madhwan in the film? Actually, Madhavan has acted in the film as Nambin Ranin. But I think he has lived as Nambina Renal. And he has without my knowledge actually he has understood my mannerisms.
1657365424.0-1657390530.0
The way in which I see, the way in which I love, the way in which all kinds of things he has done it perfectly well. And the technicians, it gives me a doubt whether it is myself or himself. And that clothes he has acted, he has depicted. Yeah. So how difficult was it to let a biopic be made on your life?
1657392740.0-1657419720.0
Well, if you understand and there are events which took place in my life and if you are convinced on it, that's the case with motherwan. And then it is not difficult. Only thing is it is your talent, it is your ability to act, it's your ability to reproduce the whole picture. I think that's most important. That is what he has done it successfully.
1657421420.0-1657444540.0
My question was how difficult was it for you to let a film be made on yourself? Sir, Madwan is an actor. But for you to relive what happened, how difficult was it for you? No, actually I have not relived in that film excepting for the last scene. But otherwise it was only Madhavan who was acting in that film.
1657444620.0-1657495680.0
And suddenly I have told, we have discussed more than five, six years, the various issues, the various materials, et cetera. So it is certainly difficult for me to explain the whole thing from my memory, from my documentation, et cetera. But at times you become really sensational and you become really you collapse on that certain things when you want to really, it's not easy. And certain issues like the torture in the police custody, et cetera, well, he has to understand if he has to take the film properly, but then I have to tell him what is what. He was really a drama in the sense but then suddenly I made myself clear to him what is what.
1657495830.0-1657510630.0
And the result is you are seeing in the movie and the fact remains that everybody believes the movie. Why? Because it is so realistic and it is not unbelievable in that sense. Yeah.
1657512840.0-1657525610.0
Is the depiction throughout the over to our film accurate to what happened in your life? Sure, it is very accurate. Very accurate, I should say that.
1657528320.0-1657545824.0
Or is it over dramatized? Some places I think it is under dramatized. It is not over dramatized. I mean, if you were asking for the torture part of it, what is shown in the movie is less than what really has happened. And we didn't want to dramatize it at all.
1657545862.0-1657577390.0
We didn't want to add any cinematic effect to that. That is the truth of the whole thing. My personal apologies to user for what happened, some things which certainly should not have happened. And as the correspondent who reports science and technology on my personal behalf, please accept my heartfelt apologies for what you had to go through. And finally, the Supreme Court also exonerated you.
1657579920.0-1657636284.0
It's not easy for what happened. Now tell us a little bit about your early life which has been shown in the film. You see, the beginning of my career, I started my career with Rakhi Karam Sarabi, and then after his death, I happened to work with Professor Adi Saban, and then with Professor Yuza, with these three Stalwarts. I had spent something close to 30 years. And so I could sort of work towards a goal wherein there were difficulties in the beginning with respect to the approvals, with respect to the financial element in it, and with respect to their own conviction in making sure that the electric propulsion systems will be possible to develop.
1657636482.0-1657674360.0
Because you remember, at that time there was no pollen, not even axelizer, no fuel and no material which can stand that high temperature, et cetera. But as time went by, as shown in the movie, we started with 600 kg rocket, then we moved to 310 and there was an explosion because it had a combined beating. And that kind of a problem. Then I got fed up. You really don't have the approval, you don't have the manpower, you don't have the finance, and you don't have the place to test your material.
1657675900.0-1657704660.0
From Tumba we were asked to go to Sri Lata where the land was very free and you can do anything you want. But the problem is Srikota was just like coming in that time. And there was not even only one jeep or two jeeps. Then you had to go 5 km inside the arts and there was not even a shelter. And with all makeshift arrangements sheds like that very difficult to explain.
1657704730.0-1657728380.0
But when the explosion took place, I will tell you, I knew that it is going to explode. Ask me the question. How do I know? Because after everything is cleared I was walking away from the test met to watch the firing. I remembered all of a sudden that I had any mistake in calibration correction.
1657728720.0-1657742764.0
Okay? How the hell the calibration correction came is because we had fine sand particles floating in the water. And then that has misguided us and we should have corrected it. We didn't. But then I wanted to stop the firing.
1657742892.0-1657759828.0
But where the hell you are going to stop it? Because there is no communication between the firing place and myself. You can't shout, you can't hear, it is an agony. You please understand. You know that it is going to explode, but you have no way to stop it.
1657759994.0-1657778916.0
But you have to live with that. And that is the time I said that it is Janafishana. There is no point in continuing with this kind of a mess. So I met Professor Davin and professor both happened to be in the Madras guest house. So I told them I explored this socket.
1657779028.0-1657796850.0
I took the responsibility for that explosion and I said that last would be there in the order of about two to three lakhs. I want that responsibility. Please relieve me from this job. I can't do this any that is a struggle. So that way then they said no.
1657802960.0-1657808130.0
I'm losing a little bit of the internet connection with you. Sir, can you hear me?
1657811590.0-1657832790.0
We are having some internet issues. At the end of Mr. Namin Narayan, he was trying to explain to us what happened at testimony. Yes, sir. So what we did was we talked about the SAP proposal and it was a joint development.
1657834990.0-1657859038.0
But then, very funny. Both of them said we will not give you money, but we will give you permission to have a giant collaboration. Find your way. So, to make a long story short, it was a giant proposal wherein we had the 52 people totalling 200 mania. But eventually it got extended to 100 and 2530 mania.
1657859214.0-1657875430.0
We were working for them in some areas and we were working for us in some areas. And that yielded the so called VicAs engine. That is what he was seeing as workhorse engine for his role in PSR.
1657877450.0-1657892682.0
It's not the so called VicAs engine. It is the VicAs engine, sir. Yeah. And you named it so well, not development. But after Vikramambala Sarabhai, what a beautiful name you gave to the engine.
1657892816.0-1657914898.0
And today, as we talk about vicars for India, I think the VicAs engine, correct me if I'm wrong, has never failed in any of our launches. Is that correct, sir? Yeah. 53 launches we have made, including the recent one, and not even a single failure. Failures can be due to some other thing, but not on account of VicAs engine.
1657915064.0-1657936634.0
I used to say funneli, it is difficult to make this engine to fail unless you want it to fail. So it has a built in reliability. That is an outcome of the hard work we had put in there. That is the most interesting part of it. No, certainly VicAs is our workhorse engine.
1657936832.0-1657970920.0
Every rocket, every rocket literally has VicAs engine somewhere embedded in it. You also played a role in the cryogenic engine. Let us talk a little bit about that and what it meant for India. Actually, along with the recruit, the biggest engine, we were planning to have a cryogenic system also. But Process Darwin felt that it is better that you know how to stand and then walk before running.
1657971690.0-1657999390.0
So I see he's correct. Because we were talking about failed three ton engines and we are talking about 60 ton liquid engine. Then we combined with cryogenic which is also a liquid system. But we didn't have hydrogen, we didn't have anything. So at that time it will be interesting for you to note that the HM seven, which is the French cryogenic, was available just for one crore.
1658000930.0-1658024594.0
Now, for the same one crore engine, we later played post quotations where thousand crores but we played 235 crores to get the technology. But that also didn't go through. That is due to external pressures and the contract has to be scrapped and it has to be redefined. And that KVD one didn't come through. That was one setback.
1658024642.0-1658055966.0
Because if you had the Viking along with the because engineer, if you had the collision, you are really becoming a person with high capability. You can become more or less like a super space power. But it didn't it didn't go through. I was the project director for the Craving Unique engine and we went through that from 91 to 93, part of 94. Another two years or one and a half years would have made all the difference.
1658056068.0-1658071838.0
But it didn't happen. So my dreams got shuttered. So you have no choice. And that's the time the so called bikers took place. And I was kept away from the entire scenario.
1658071934.0-1658109634.0
Not somebody kept me away, but it was a system, it was a law of the land. I was under suspension. I can't enter into the visa because I mean in the organization for about 18 months. And after 18 months I didn't feel like going towards the development to take the same position because you need some kind of a commanding position to do the job as a project director. But I can't go and stand with this stigma on my face and then go and try to command them.
1658109752.0-1658138650.0
And what happened is if I would have insisted they would have given me that position but then it would spoil the project itself, I knew. So I didn't want to be the person, the reason for stumbling block of the whole project. I said all right, let somebody else take care of it. So that is how the whole thing went through. And then you have delays associated with them that is in short about the crogenic father.
1658141310.0-1658151870.0
Let me also ask you because in the film there is a lot of depiction of what went through in the later part of your career.
1658154130.0-1658190860.0
What really happened in this so called spy case and now you've been exonerated by the highest court of India, compensation awarded. What happened? What did you feel at that point, sir? Well, naturally I was happy because I was working towards that to prove my innocence which I hope I have proved it not once but twice in the Supreme Court. Now the Supreme Court has now ordered trial to be conducted on the suspected accused people the entire matter.
1658191630.0-1658201760.0
So naturally I was happy. But now the matter is between the ACBI and then the accused people ask for the Supreme Court order.
1658203890.0-1658252586.0
But can you tell us a little bit of what happened when the first arrest happened and the kind of third degree which the police and intelligence bureau subjected you to which is depicted in the film and you said it is under dramatized. I think some people in the audience may want to know how did you live through it? Well, the answer to that question is you have seen the movie and you please ask the audiences to also go and see the movie. It is not to enhance the revenue of the movie but to understand the answer for this question. You yourself go watch the movie.
1658252618.0-1658281260.0
You will understand everything from that movie. It is very well depicted, very well brought out. I understand that the majority of viewers were really shocked to go through that bill. When I said under dramatized I didn't want to use the word under dramatized because you asked me whether it is over theatrized I felt that it is not over the matter. Then how do I explain it is one step low.
1658281710.0-1658305134.0
Why? Because it is like this violence. If you show in a movie beyond a limit, it is not allowed and it will really spoil the minds of the people or the viewers. To that extent we have brought down the violence which was third degree. But then your next question is how did I stand?
1658305332.0-1658339820.0
I believe in God. Okay, I knew that this will come through in my favor. But only thing is I should have the stamina, I should have the mind, I should have the will cover then I should have the blessing of God, which I did, which is true now. Now every India and every people in the world knew what is what. Of course, there are certain questions which are to be answered very openly for which you have to wait for some more time.
1658342510.0-1658397870.0
Because somebody who's looked at the Indian space program closely and has followed the so called ISO Spionage case, even I was shocked to see the kind of third degree which you as honorable scientists had to face. When I was there in the theater watching the film, people around me were completely shell shocked as to how in India we could do this to somebody who is so patriotic and loyal to the country. You said you believed in God. What gave you the strength to continue this battle, to exonerate yourself? Because in the courts you were literally very lonely.
1658400290.0-1658419640.0
When you believe in God, you are nowhere lonely. You have the God with you. When I was sitting in the bandas on the floors of Supreme Court, I was lonely, I agree. But eventually now you are seeing, am I alone now? Today.
1658420410.0-1658431698.0
I am not. No. Yeah. So it is your faith, your conviction, your belief which makes all the difference. Temporarily you are alone.
1658431874.0-1658473510.0
That's it today. But of course, nothing matters to me other than the strong will with which I fought this case primarily to sell the name of my family that stood by me and I ought to pay back in some sense. So, as I told you earlier in your personal discussion, I was never a good husband, I was never a good father. I dedicated myself to something else which I feel and I regret today I should have spent some more time with my family. The family alone was standing by my side, as you said, when I was alone.
1658473930.0-1658508880.0
So I felt that that is not the right thing to do. So today I'm trying to do maximum try to see with my family. That's why even with repeated request for interview, I was trying to sort of delay it or some kind of a thing, because I just felt an official now it is a matter between what do you call the CBI and then the court let him go through that. So I feel I'm happy.
1658511270.0-1658521400.0
Are you happy with the depiction in the film? I'm absolutely happy. There is no doubt about it. I'm happy because it is giving the true picture of myself.
1658524570.0-1658556930.0
Now, I should also ask you, in a way, a lot of the honor has been restored for you. But the lost years and the lost work can never get restored. The compensation is not enough. But there is one happy moment I should bring out for the audience, which is the presence of Mr. Arunan, your son in law who was leading India's mission to Mars Mongolian.
1658559270.0-1658596458.0
While you were fighting your case, arun took on that job and delivered to India. Anand made an effort to send India's Mongolian into the orbit of Mars. Did that moment kind of give you the faith and restoration in both your family and in India? Well, the feet of Mangalyan was great. And the feet of Mangalayan in the first attempt wherein we could get success, the way in which you reach the mass orbit was excellent.
1658596634.0-1658633500.0
So that achievement I was happy. But suddenly it so happened that my son in law happened to be the project director of it which suddenly adds additional happiness to myself individually. And I found him as a very intelligent, very hardworking chap. But then in the mind of mind, you must understand, when Mangalyan took place and when I was going through the sufferings, I was just thinking about it. I am not able to sort of digest what is the point in working hard?
1658633950.0-1658649950.0
What is the point in achieving these things? After all, finally, you know, with all those things I just didn't bother about my job in NASA. But I came back and then did all those things. But what did I get titled? Spy.
1658650370.0-1658668610.0
Okay, but to overcome that I had to work hard another 27 years. And you will believe that 19 Adjoinments. This is our system. What can you do? In fact, that is where the patience is required and your tolerance is required.
1658669190.0-1658686182.0
Anyway, it ended up in good. Good thing. Nice. Now I also want you to relive two more moments for me. One first time when the Vicar engine flew in the Polar Satellite Launch vehicle.
1658686326.0-1658702160.0
And the second moment when the first cryogenic engine flew in the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch vehicle. Mark two. Just relive those two moments for me. You are going through a lot of trouble. At least in the second one.
1658702530.0-1658715534.0
But how did you feel, sir? The first one, that is Vegas engine. I was extremely happy. It went through nicely, beautifully as expected. And that is a creation.
1658715662.0-1658731174.0
So that gives a satisfaction. But the second one, yes, it went through. But it was not the one which we were visualizing it. It was not the one which we wanted it. But it is a mix of things.
1658731372.0-1658746490.0
I don't want to go more on that issue. But finally, yes, there is a cryogenic system which went up and to that extent I was happy. But it is like this. How can you say that you are not happy? You are happy because it is a development.
1658746990.0-1658769560.0
But supposing if it is the one which you wanted it, don't you think that you will be very happy because it straightaway takes you to different orbit level, different capacity wise. But anyway, I don't have difficulty in reliving those things. It is good, it is nice. And any achievement what we make in Israel keeps me happy.
1658772250.0-1658798400.0
There are both questions offline which have come to me and there are questions which are coming online from the participants. One offline question came to me was you met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How was it like meeting him? Because he seems to be, as said many times, a space buff who understands a lot of the space technology.
1658800450.0-1658830738.0
Well, he is a great prime minister. He could not only understand, but also appreciates the hard work behind the whole thing. So when he gave me the Batma Bhushan, he meant it actually. In fact, he was asking the one which I am showing in the film was explained to him in detail. It is not just because I fought a case and won the case.
1658830924.0-1658867570.0
The award is not for that. The award is for what I have gone through, which our prime minister very well understood and it's on record, it's on paper. So that is a kind of impression. Again, I am lucky to have such a prime minister who could understand and appreciate the difficulties. Now, simultaneously, when we are discussing this most recently at the initiative and behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there is an opening up for the unlocking of the space sector.
1658868970.0-1658905054.0
I'll also ask you about what happened due to Cryogenic. But with the current unlocking which is happening, do you see some future in commercial space for India? You see, the commercial aspect is extremely good for India because ours is, as you know very well, the biggest engine never fails. So we have high reliability built in in our system and the cost is low because we have taken intelligent way of designing the system. So why the hell we can't succeed in the commercial part of it?
1658905172.0-1658939462.0
But the problem is, how do we plan it? How do we decide? For example, when I'm seeing in the newspapers some private companies are fighting to make PSLVs, I'm not able to really appreciate the whole thing. Now it is time that we should look for advancement in the space related matter. And there are so many gaps we have, they have to be filled and you won't have to take action in advance.
1658939526.0-1658963758.0
Before we talk about parallel, we talk about the privatization part of it, the privatization. We are not going to equate ourselves to USA or France for that matter here. We are talking about industries. Those industries were only producing things for us. They were not in the development of systems.
1658963934.0-1658983062.0
Whereas in the US, if you take rocket science, aerogen, General Corporation, Hercules Powder Company, so on and so forth, they were all doing the research and development. Now, ours is production. So we need certain corrections before we embark on this. I'm sure that there are enough expertise available to do this. Correction.
1658983126.0-1658984860.0
They can do it very well.
1658987150.0-1659022070.0
Let me come back to the question on cryogenic. In your opinion, was the Islo espionage case which was heaved on you and I must say, unjustly unfairly, and now you have been exonerated. I am repeating that again and again, your honor, restored by the supreme Court. We lost almost 20 years. So do you think that was the reason that India should not get the know how the technology and become a competitor?
1659023130.0-1659051710.0
Well, it could be one of the reasons. As you know, there are evidences available which states that the external powers were interested in breaking the contract and then applied pressure on the Russians and we were forced to redo the contract. I mean, what was what else? Because they said that it is going to yield method of Crayogenic missiles. Where is the Crayogenic missile?
1659052130.0-1659071960.0
There is no Crayogenic missile in the world even today. Those things are very little complex and political and interpret sort of things. I would like to stop there because these are things which have to be discussed at the highest level. And then they have to try to take and understand the whole thing.
1659074010.0-1659113874.0
I don't want to press further, but see as we go in for more commercialization, go into the 400 billion dollar market, go up to a trillion and a half dollar market of the space market. The lost time is what many people are asking in India. Had numbers not been pushed into a corner, we could have gotten stuff much earlier. Do you kind of concur with that at least that we could have gotten our cryogenic and the rockets much more earlier? Well, the question and the answer both are obvious.
1659114072.0-1659144320.0
Now, I don't want to say it will look as if I am boasting around, but certainly I feel suddenly I would have played a crucial role in filling the gap. Even now, I'm telling you, forget about me. Even now, if they take the proper steps, you can sort of close that 1520 years gap and then try to overtake and exploit the present situation, which is not difficult at all. According to me, it is possible.
1659147410.0-1659172760.0
Our very famous space correspondent Sri Nawaz Lukshman, the son of R. K. Lukshman, who also saw the film and has interacted with you on earlier occasions, was wanting to join in the audience. He sends his best wishes to you. And he also asks again that same question.
1659174010.0-1659196750.0
A lonely battle fought by Nambi Narayanan and one where do you get the power? Is it cryogenics? Is it liquid propulsion which is firing you or solid propulsion which is firing you? It's neither propulsion, neither liquid nor solid. Because, as you know, the fight was to prove my innocence.
1659197570.0-1659219860.0
And it was not for liquid or solid or craziness. The point is, what bothered me more was what the hell? How can they say that I am a spy? I can't put up with that unless you play the role of myself in the entire episode. I think it is difficult for many people to understand the agony I have gone through.
1659220550.0-1659247182.0
That is the whole thing. It is not anything else. That is the force which pushed me into the right orbit. And of course, as I said God grace was there with me all along. Your family also faced a lot of problems your wife also faced issues has she been able to come to terms with it after so many years?
1659247236.0-1659279160.0
And you are getting some honor restored, sir? Yeah, actually, as I told you that everything is due to Almighty. She has come back to normal and she's living with me. And we are of course we have gone through this mill and naturally you can't do anything about it now, accepting whatever is the corrective measures and whatever award and reward which comes actually it has no effect on us. Only thing is we feel happy.

At least people understand what is what. And my family is with me very much. In fact, they used to be with me right from the beginning. Even today, this is only me who was not with my family in the beginning. I am the culprit.
1659293126.0-1659315410.0
Not they are the culprit, certainly. But somewhere you gave so much for India. You gave your time, you gave your effort. You put in everything. Both for getting the Viking to VicAs from cryogenic to Indian cryogenic and all of the effort.

What next for Mr. Nambin, Ariana? Now. Well, I really don't know. As far as I am concerned, I must record here.
1659326236.0-1659352938.0
My sincere thanks to people like you who are trying to help me out in making the story known to more people. And Mr. Madhavan played a critical and clear role. I can't explain the troubles he has gone through and the weeks he has taken in doing this movie. I used to call he's again a godsend man to do this movie.
1659353034.0-1659369938.0
Otherwise, this movie, it will be different. So that way, what is next is something which somebody will have to ask me. Somebody I have to think about it. There are so many things possible. Whether I have the mind to do it is another question.
1659370024.0-1659384698.0
But I hope I will have the mind to do something I can't keep quiet anyway. So that is a situation. Have you been able to pardon India for what you went through? Who am I to pardon India? Actually the country is good.
1659384784.0-1659416500.0
The people are good. I have faith in them for some known and unknown reasons some couple of guys, they have done this crime now why should I blame the Indian country for them? I'm not that shortsighted but suddenly I feel sad or I felt sad when the country took the queue from a different wrong person and then the media played a major role in that sort of thing but today I'm happy because everything is set right.

Do you have any message for the young generation? Especially the startups which are working hard to bring space technology at the forefront for India and I have met many of those youngsters 25 year old 27 year olds they are full of energy. Any message for them, sir? Yeah, my message is. Very simple.
1659445700.0-1659472034.0
Very simple and clear. I'm not talking about the startups or something like that. I'm talking in general to the younger generation. If you believe in certain things and if you think that that is the right thing to do, no matter what it is, you continue to do that right thing and you please make sure that you are doing it. You don't leave it in the middle just because of somebody else that asks you not to do it.
1659472232.0-1659482810.0
So that is the only message. I say that it all depends on your conviction. If you are convinced that this is the right thing to do, please do that. That is the only service you can do to the nation.
1659484990.0-1659530120.0
And any message for your former colleagues at the Indian Space Research Organization and the Department of Space as they embark on new journeys? I better not give any message in that sense, I am not a philosopher or I am willing to give messages to my younger generations. My older generations, they know all the messages so I have nothing to basically say anything about it. And do you think towards the end one quick question to you do you think the government should chase down the perpetrators of this crime and get to the bottom of this? Absolutely.
1659531690.0-1659553774.0
Because whether they are punished or not is immaterial. But I think they should be exposed. They should be exposed and they should be made. It is known to all the people that these are the culprits who are responsible for all this calamity and why? Because such things cannot happen once again in any other field of science and technology particular.
1659553972.0-1659587500.0
And of course, as I told you in person, let us learn to recognize and acknowledge the people who were behind such big things. For example, I don't know how to name it, but let me tell you my counterpart Rajaram nahapa is the person who is responsible for the 150. Tonight I am doing liquid but nobody knows his name. What is it? Is it a scene that he has done?
1659588270.0-1659617566.0
He has developed and you can be proud of it and he was second to us for that. But unfortunately this kind of a trend should change. We should know how to celebrate our people who have contributed to the nation. And I just cited a name but there are so many people who are in that position. I think they should be recognized, they should be acknowledged and they should be celebrated.
1659617758.0-1659646800.0
I think it gives they are not getting a big salary, but poultry some as Professor David said, powdery sum, they are working. They could have gone like these it people or in so many ways and they can make much more money but still they are sticking here. They are doing this job for what? This satisfaction? If you give them the pleasure of okay, I am being recognized and acknowledged in this country that will be the greatest thing you can do for these people.
1659647890.0-1659677862.0
Certainly. And I must tell the audience that Nambi Narayanan SAB's son in law Arun is also a hero for the country for the Mangalyan mission. On the same lines as M. Anadray is another living legend from current times who may give India the Chandrayaan One mission and most of the Chandrayaan Two missions. And the current chairman, Mr.
1659677916.0-1659712446.0
Somnath is also working hard to give India something very special which is the Gaganyan mission which is to send an Indian astronaut in space from Indian soil. That is a longer discussion, Mr. Nambin Naranan. I think the Gaganyan mission we can discuss at some other point. Now, on the film overall, do you have any highlights, any regrets which could have either the film could have done better or what is the best part of the film which you liked?
1659712638.0-1659722962.0
I like the whole thing. The whole thing because it is depicting the truth. What is most important is that it is depicting the truth. I like it. I have no regrets.
1659723026.0-1659741020.0
In fact, you can add something more which can be later. Not necessarily in this film. This film talks about the sufferings I have gone through and then the contribution I have made. That's the main part in that movie which was successfully done. So I'm happy about it.
1659741470.0-1659775282.0
And neither the film has discussed nor are we discussing the politics of how it happened and what happened during that. Let's leave that for another discussion. Both Nambi sir and I are a little familiar with the intense political issues which were happening in the background. One last point, sir. After the film and after you have gone through and got yourself exonerated, can we make sure that another ISL espionage case of the kind which Mr.
1659775336.0-1659790326.0
Nambin Aran went through does not happen? I think so. We have given enough caution. We have paid a penalty. So people will be more cautious.
1659790438.0-1659796320.0
They will suddenly be more careful in not repeating this. I'm sure about it.
1659803570.0-1659818254.0
You're smiling and satisfied, it seems, with the effort made in the film Rocketry The Numbie Effect. Correct, sir? Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure listening and speaking to you, Nambina.
1659818302.0-1659845918.0
Answer. And once again on this show, on my personal behalf, please accept my personal apologies for what you went through. And I hope no other scientist, engineer or Indian has to go through that kind of third degree for serving the country for a specific cause. Today, all rockets carry your signature and India is grateful for that. Thanks a lot, sir.
1659846004.0-1659871314.0
Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. And a lovely audience there who patiently waited for the It issues to get resolved and then to listen to the real hero who is now playing out in reels in the film Rocketry the Numbi Effect, made by R. Madhwan. Madhwan has done a very good job on the film.
1659871362.0-1659897326.0
He has acted, he has not used prosthetics to give himself the look of Mr. Nambi Naranan. And as Mr. Nambi Naranan says he has imbibed a lot of what the person in Nambisa is to depict on the film. I hope here onwards, at some point we should see more happier biopics being made.
1659897508.0-1659938662.0
And my personal wishes that a film and a biopic should be made on Arunan, india's man who took India to the mars orbit on the maiden visit. And the love and affection arunan and Nambisar share and the family shares. My thanks to the audience and to numb researcher for sparing the time in this very busy period. And may you find peace and may India find more numbi Narayanans who can make India proud in times to come. Thanks a lot sir.
1659938796.0-1659940340.0
Thank you so much. Bye bye sir.

Hello everybody. Welcome to the first episode of The South Story. And today we have with us director Dipa Crediti. His Telugu short film, manasanamaha has won Guinness World Record and has won 500 plus international awards. And today we are going to be talking to him about his film.
1658008506.0-1658018550.0
What are his future plans, among other things. I hope you have a great time during the show. Welcome Deepak. Hi, Franka. I hope you're doing good.
1658018620.0-1658041646.0
I hope all the appointments have been working out well for you. Yeah, great. So Deepak, let's start with how you began work on Mana Cinema. It's a short film, so compared to a feature film, how you started it would be different, I'm guessing. So what was it like for you to start work on this?
1658041668.0-1658063970.0
Work? Basically I was doing my masters in the US. So I was always into filmmaking. My likeliness and my love for cinema was always there. So I just thought about getting back to India and pitching stories to the Tallwood producers because I was trying to get into direction, lecture direction.
1658065670.0-1658092810.0
But as I came back to India, I didn't know how to approach people. Approaching producers is like a big deal for me. I didn't know how to go carry my scripts to the production office and ask for appointments and all. So I thought I should just make a demo film which can maybe seen by the producers and then they'll allow me to listen to my stories and all. So I just took my chance and I started working on Mansanama.
1658092890.0-1658118814.0
The idea was pretty personal to me. The idea of making Mansanama was pretty personal. So the story, I just didn't have any team and support at all. But my whole point in making Mansanama was to make it as a demo film and then pitch it to the producer so that they'll understand what kind of filmmaker I am and they'll be ready to make a film with me. So that is the whole point in the idea of starting Mansanama.
1658118942.0-1658136346.0
So that's way back in 2018, I guess I started working on the line. I just wrote the script in two days. It didn't take much time, so I just got the idea and just put it on paper so it was done. But the most challenging part was I didn't have any team. I didn't have proper, what do you call a technical team, support and all.
1658136368.0-1658182540.0
So I just pulled all my friends who are into a musician and the DP who is to work with, work on some wedding films without team, like my friends team and all. So I just pulled over and I was like, no, I don't have much budget for this film, but I want to make this film, so please be a part of it. So my major problem was to cast. The casting was the most difficult part because you can't just cast your friends and put in your film because it needs good actors and also good looking faces as it's a romantic comedy. That part took so much time for me I almost auditioned for six months to get ride cast for this film then I found the right cast and then we went on shoot we just shot the film for five days.
1658182910.0-1658219942.0
We just shot it in five days but the pre production was pretty exhausting stuff it took almost four months for the pre production and we just shot it for five days and then the post production took almost like three to four months. The whole process took almost a year to just make one shot so it was a tiring experience but still this is all went into making months an. Hour so when you made it, did you think about submitting the film for international festivals? How did you end up garnering 513 awards? No.
1658220076.0-1658237946.0
To be frank, I don't say against, but I'm not kind of a festival filmmaker. I'm pretty commercial. My ideas and all are pretty. I make horrors, thrillers. My previous short films are like horrors and thrillers and comedies.
1658238058.0-1658283014.0
So they are not like I don't make films to what you call I don't make films to impress festival directors or films that are societical it's basically commercial the ideology myel is pretty commercial but I never thought about submitting mansana to film festivals. After I made it, I sent it a few friends of mine so who are saying the film is pretty good. So why don't you submit to the festival? Then I said, I don't think I have the budget to send it to festivals so my pointers are already exhausted so I can't find it. So one of my friends came forward and said I'll sponsor you to send it to set up festivals.
1658283062.0-1658309650.0
Please send it because I think the film will do pretty well in the film festival circuit. So then I sent it to the festivals. So we just had a bunch of 15 film festivals that we've submitted in the beginning we got almost into twelve festivals and we have almost 1 hour in almost eight to nine film festivals in the span of a few months. Then I thought, okay, this film is respected. Well, in the film to film festivals are Q two because the way it's been made is what mattered.
1658310310.0-1658317700.0
It's not the concept or the ideology of making this film. Can you hear me?
1658320470.0-1658326040.0
The paku kind of froze in between. There yeah now is it good now? Yeah.
1658328590.0-1658344910.0
So one of my friends came forward and he sponsored me for the first set of film festivals. Then they did pretty well in all the film festivals that were Circuit Majorly. Our film has done pretty well in the USA Film Festival circuit. We've got into almost like top ten and top 25 film festivals in North America.
1658347170.0-1658374294.0
So we went on winning ours, even in some of them. So then we've decided, like my producer and other people, they're like, why don't we if it is doing pretty well, why don't we send it to the film festivals more and more? So we almost screened in 185 film festivals all over the world. Includes australia, new zealand, UK, europe, canada, us. India the least.
1658374332.0-1658406526.0
The film has performed according to the film festival securities India. So, compared to all other countries, because, I don't know, our approach for films are different. So we don't categorize comedy and romance into film festival subjects. But we've done like best film at Sea poor international Film Festival new Delhi International Film Festival we've done pretty well in some festivals, but the Oscar qualifying thing haven't happened in India because it was Bengaluru. International Short Film Festival is the only Oscar Qualification Festival from India.
1658406638.0-1658430826.0
We have made it to the festival, but we didn't go through that festival to make it into Oscars. We are academically qualified, but it has happened from some other film festival from the US. So this is one thing, but I'm not a film festival director, to be frank. But I'm telling this a lot of people when they're not believing so many hours, how can't you be a film festival director? But this is what it is.
1658430848.0-1658453780.0
I just make honest films that excites me, but I don't basically target or concentrate on film festival. Right. So, speaking about the film itself, I like the concept of mixing live action and animated together. Part of the film is animated and part of the film is live action. Why did you choose to go that route and how did you create that in your head?
1658454870.0-1658477122.0
Yeah, basically, I wanted this film to be a fairy tale. I wanted to experiment maximum that I could on a just pie meets girl love story. So my whole point was, the story has to be so simple that a guy meets girl and a girl is unhappy with him. So they just fight and they just break up. This is what the story was supposed to be in the beginning.
1658477186.0-1658496670.0
So I just wanted to experiment as much as I could. Be the narrative, be the style, beat everything. So that's where I wanted it to be. A fairy tale opens up in a coffee shop and I wanted the setup to be a cartoonisher animated, so that even kids would be interested to watch it. So, as it is most like a fairy tale opening kind of thing.
1658496740.0-1658526978.0
And then it translates the transition into a live action. Then again, whenever it is needed, I just make it animated again. So that to bring that little impact of the film being a fairy tale. That's the whole point, actually. Okay, so the majority of the film is about this man, one man complaining about complaining, observing, all of that, about how the women in his life have, over the years, his experience with women and relationships.
1658527074.0-1658548238.0
And then it ends with a girl it ends with that girl saying, oh my God. It's not just the boys who have the problem, but the girl's perspective is not like explore, it's left as an open thing. There's a whole lot that needs to be explored. Do you plan on releasing episode two? Actually, my plan was to make a feature out of it.
1658548324.0-1658562642.0
So we discuss about both of the perspectives. So that is the reason the hook was left at the end of the day. So do you plan to make this into a feature film or has that plan changed? Okay? Yes, I do.
1658562776.0-1658580620.0
This is going to be made into a feature for sure. But I can't guarantee if it's going to be my first film because I've been working on different scripts. Speaking about feature films, are you working towards making one right now? Are you writing? What is your journey at the moment?
1658581470.0-1658605602.0
So basically, when I made Mansanama as a shot, I had a feature idea of making Mansana into a feature. So that was the whole point that I made a demo film, the short for the feature. But it was pretty indie kind of stuff. But what happened was I've been approached by a lot of big produce production houses right after the last month. So I think the scales and budgets have gone a little high.
1658605656.0-1658621462.0
The staff who wants to work with me and all. So there's a lot of things that have happened in the past year. So then I started working on I've been working on different different scripts. But right now we are locked on something. So there's going to be a feature pretty soon.
1658621516.0-1658644254.0
I've been working a very big production house, I don't think because I can't let out the name, but the banner, but as they haven't announced it, so I shouldn't be doing it. But Indian Productionals is producing my film. So I'm working on the feature right now. It might anytime enter the pre production stage. Can you tell us about maybe the genre of the script that you're working on?
1658644292.0-1658648480.0
If not the film itself? Maybe the genre, how close it is?
1658650610.0-1658671414.0
See, one thing is for sure, I've been working on the feature of Mansanama's feature for almost six months. Six months? But I'm but I can't guarantee which one I'm going to make right now. So it's going to be it's going to take some more time, but when I know it, when I finalize on it, I'm going to tell you for sure. You'll be the first person that I'll be telling you.
1658671532.0-1658674440.0
Thank you. I'm looking forward to that for sure.
1658676510.0-1658690560.0
Let's speak about how life has changed for you after the success of Manathanamaha with the people within the film industry that you meet, fellow directors, seniors. How has the experience been for you?
1658692690.0-1658723974.0
Right from the lockdown, I think the whole 2021 I've been overwhelmed with I haven't expected this kind of reception. So almost like every big star like a lot of big stars from the industry have supported me, contacted me, said good things, support me like Anushkasheti Rashmi Kamandana adevish. A lot of film people have really encouraged me. They loved my work. And it was pretty overwhelming because I wasn't a film person at all.
1658724092.0-1658735450.0
I just made into this industry with my short film. Before that, I never had a film background at all. So I didn't understand for a few days. I was pretty number. I don't know what I'm doing now.
1658735520.0-1658745502.0
Maybe people are expecting something used. Maybe I don't even know what kind of filmmaker I am. Maybe I'm just a personal maker who want to make personal things. Like. I'm a great fan of Gotham, sir.
1658745556.0-1658773506.0
Gotham? So maybe my approach is something like that. But I don't know if I could just get into something which is pretty commercial. And also when the stars and all the production of The Sun All I have started contract was like, but I've just wrote a film which has to be done in like two to three course because my friends are killing some relatives of mine. They were like, we'll produce a film, we'll just put money, just go and make a film.
1658773698.0-1658792490.0
They started like that. So I was supposed to make an indie film. But right now, as I can say, there's a lot of support that's been pouring from the industry. Then I started making about, okay, this is once in a lifetime opportunity for a filmmaker. It's not easy for a filmmaker to get been approached by big production officers and actors and all.
1658792560.0-1658819494.0
So I just thought of sitting expanding my story to a better level. Because the shorter that I've made is already like an indie film, but it's just been less duration. But it's almost like an indie film which is made in one to two per budget. So then I convinced myself saying, okay, this is a tough time after the pandemic and all people want to see something exciting. And people to get them to theaters, we need to do something exciting which is not being seen by them before.
1658819612.0-1658843950.0
So that is the reason I took some time and I gave a lot of thought about what I have to be doing as my first feature film. So it took a while, but right now I think I'm in the right space. It's been happening for almost a year. So tell me about how you collaborated with UV Creations. Right now, the Telco Original is on their official YouTube channel.
1658844020.0-1658848800.0
So tell us about that collaboration. I see that big smile on your face.
1658852050.0-1658869640.0
Basically, I wasn't supposed to tell this, but I'm working for UV Creations right now. That is the reason they uploaded the film. I expected as much, so I wanted to talk further on that. I understand you can't discuss this project, but how did that collaboration come about?
1658871930.0-1658895840.0
What started that collaboration? So basically, see a lot of producers who have watched the film has called me and offered me a film like if I'm ready to make a film. So Uvig racens is one among them. And I personally love the way the producer is with me. So I had given my thought about working with them.
1658898290.0-1658904750.0
I call him Ana. He's like a brother to me. He's like pretty close and pretty supportive.
1658907030.0-1658930186.0
I have to tell you this because he's the one who sponsored me to send the film to the film festivals, actually. So because he's met me before, everything has happened before, even he just watched once in a while and thought of meeting me. So we went down a meeting. The first meeting itself has gone around 4 hours long. So we spoke a lot.
1658930208.0-1658969640.0
And then I have to work with people like this who understand me. I'll work here, I'll just want to make film here. So then they are pretty working with me. But it's taking a little while because the other films have been in production like Radisham and other films I've actually taken my time. On working with your freezing again.
1658970170.0-1658972200.0
Your screen is frozen again.
1658978090.0-1658981740.0
I'm sorry. Deepak. Your screen is frozen again.
1658985370.0-1658986120.0
Yeah.
1658996670.0-1658999210.0
No, it's still slow. It's still slow.
1659005650.0-1659007760.0
My network is working well, I don't know.
1659012370.0-1659021442.0
My network is it better now? Yeah, it's better now. It's better now. Okay, yeah, sorry. Can you let's continue.
1659021576.0-1659040522.0
Yeah. That was nuts. I decided I haven't told this to anyone about my feature so far, but this is the first time you just asked me why I had to realize. Furthermore, updates, whatever I get, I'll let you know. But right now it's too early, I think, to that.
1659040576.0-1659079490.0
Yeah, of course. Understandable. So tell me about how when you use your short firm as a demo right now, where telco firm industry is, people are looking at bigger stars or even if they have nominal stars, they're looking at subjects to be greater than life or to be interesting enough to capture the attention of audiences. They're not looking for straightforward films anymore. So in this stage, what is the best thing for you to be entering as a feature film director at this point in the teleco film industry?
1659081510.0-1659100426.0
That's what I'm saying. I don't say just the Telegraph film industry. The whole country has been looking up to larger than life films. As you can see after the lockdown has happened, the films barely that were hits in the whole volume has produced pretty good stuff. I've seen some films which are really good, but they haven't worked at all.
1659100528.0-1659122994.0
Commercially speaking, they haven't worked at all. People are just they got used to watching films on OTTs, so it's become pretty easy for them. The only film that's been a hit is bullying too, I guess, which is a larger than life film which is a horror comedy. And people want to see stuff like this, like action or fantasy or horror like horror comedies. A mixture of genres and all.
1659123112.0-1659154010.0
So that's what I've been waiting up because I've got an opportunity to make a good feature film with a lot of support and all. So then I should be making something which is commercially viable too. I'll have my personal taste and style, but it has to be blended with a kind of public acceptance kind of stuff. So that is the reason I've been narrowing down all my I had marathonama script which is pretty personal. Pretty personal.
1659154080.0-1659179154.0
It's a high concept because Romcoms used to be pretty high concept before the lockdown. But right now I think romance is just categorized as something films that can be like Armstrong can just sit at home and watch the TV. So they want something else. So that is the reason I've been developing a script which is pretty larger than life. So I think this is what it needs to be because audience need to watch our films more than it's both.
1659179352.0-1659201686.0
It's like a win win. We have to make something which we like and also the audience. It can't be just completely personal. I think the films which have worked in 2017, 1819, those kind of films are not working anymore because I see every Friday I want to go to theaters. I just heard that Gargi is pretty good, like Cyprov is Gargi, which is released yesterday.
1659201798.0-1659218606.0
But I just opened BOOKMARKS and I see only two tickets booked next to my theater and nobody is watching. I don't know even if you are making brilliant films. So the point is you're making films now, the films have been characterized in two types. Are you making films for Ottis or are you making films for theaters? So if you're making for theaters, go with high concept.
1659218638.0-1659253120.0
If you are if you want to make something very good and personal and completely genre centered films, just make it for Ottis. But it is in a sense like theatrical business needs to be understood pretty well before you go ahead. So this is what has been running in my mind and I'm trying to analyze my friends are making films I've seen like pretty good, successfully, critically acclaimed films but not performing well in the theaters. And some films are critically very badly rated, but still performing well at theaters. So I've been analyzing because I need to understand what I'm paying into, right?
1659253490.0-1659270020.0
So as a director, you don't just stick to your style or your personal interest in the firm. You also think about what say the commercial viability of it when you write. You have to think about it when you write.
1659272150.0-1659283480.0
What I do is actually I never used to think like this until I made Mansana. Mansama was very personal. I just wrote whatever I wanted. I just shot whatever I wanted. I just did it the way I wanted.
1659284250.0-1659307420.0
But it was my film. Nothing was at stake except the only stake I had was my career on that film, but not anybody else. But when you make it for a feature and when staff are interested to make films with you and when you have this opportunity, you have bigger responsibility to make it reach to more people. So Mansanama hasn't reached many people. Because if you can see it's not reached, press doesn't write it even if it makes.
1659308370.0-1659328466.0
The only national press that has interviewed me so far was in India today. I don't know how they approached me and they just messaged me on Instagram and they just took my interview. But nobody else is interested. Because short things doesn't matter short a feature or a web series or something. So they are like not much explored by the media.
1659328568.0-1659345050.0
People won't be interested. And when it comes to but I've now got an opportunity to reach it to largest set of people. The whole country might watch my film if I make a feature right now. So that is the opportunity that I've got just with this film. So now I think I should be responsible.
1659346670.0-1659365930.0
I'm going to make my style films, that's for sure. Because the idea is what has to be the initial idea of making a film. So if we stuck for basically you've seen Man Sam is a romcom. But I'm not a kind of a director who just make romance films. I think romance, I'm very bad at romance.
1659366010.0-1659391578.0
I'm telling you because the other films that the other shots that you can get to see that I've made so far before Mansanama. One is a horror, one is a thriller, one is a comedy. There's no romance in the interface because you don't even believe me when I say so we try to attempt a 48 Hours film festival. 48 Hours film festival which happens every year, right? It happens in Hyderabad in 2015, I guess.
1659391744.0-1659402620.0
So I picked the cheat. They'll ask you to pick the concept. You have to shoot in 40,000 cents. I got romance. I got romance that day.
1659402990.0-1659409946.0
And I didn't know how to shoot a romance film. And I just gave up. We didn't make a film. We didn't make a film because romance is the most difficult. I thought it will get horror.
1659409978.0-1659428546.0
So I would have made a horror. But three years, four years down the lane, I made Mansanama, which is qualified for Oscars and also made it to the Guinness Book of All Regards as the most award winning film. Because it's just the idea. When I got the idea of like why shouldn't I tell a story in reverse? A lost story in reverse, that was the exciting part.
1659428648.0-1659443954.0
So if I get an idea like that, it doesn't matter for me about the genre. If I personally connect to the idea, I'll make it to commercial. So I'll make the tiger, I'll make the idea. So the idea is important, not the. Way you okay, then I get the conviction.
1659444002.0-1659458654.0
The conviction that if I get an idea but the side is very brilliant. I need to make it into a film. This is what I should be feeling. Then I'll make a commercial film with my conviction that I need to believe it. All matters to me is in my head if I believe the small idea.
1659458692.0-1659477634.0
See, I thought by me can be a story. And I made my son, I'm out of it and it is done pretty well. So that's how I believe. Speaking about Guinness world record and Oscar, people consider this like two heights of getting awards and you've already achieved it. So what can make you happy in the future?
1659477752.0-1659495594.0
What are you looking forward to get from filmmaking in the future? That's what I don't understand. My mom, last week she called me after I got the Guinness. Regardless, it's okay. Like she said, I don't care what you do after this because there's only two things that I know about in the world.
1659495632.0-1659507402.0
That is one is Guinness and one is Oscar. You qualify to ask her and you won a guineas because it's okay. You do whatever you want. I'm not bothered about what you see. So then I got it.
1659507456.0-1659534442.0
Okay? Guinness is such a huge thing. Nobody in the world it's like a record, like all records that billions of people in this world cannot achieve it. Only few, few among their areas can do that. So when I see the list, like in these records have been uploaded steam wise, there is Avengers, which is like the highest crossing and there is Shit's Creek, that show that has a number of hours on all and in the list there is mansana.
1659534606.0-1659556302.0
I just was like, there's only one Indian film which is among avengers, which is among the Ship creek and bohemian Rhapsody and all this mansoura like, okay, we have done. This is such a huge deal. And I just posted it on Twitter. I just posted it. This is the list and I've seen and yeah, that's it.
1659556356.0-1659571282.0
I just felt happy seeing that, but I don't know where. Now the responsible is pretty high. That's what I'm pretty worried about. What people are expecting from me, what actors are expecting from me and what the leaders are expecting from me. When I say how is this story?
1659571336.0-1659582786.0
When I read a description of this is your film? No. You are capable of doing much. You have to do something else. Like bored of this understanding.
1659582978.0-1659606720.0
I shouldn't be influenced by anyone. I am taking much time to start my creature. The reason is to understand what's happening and what are the expectations and how should I cut off these expectations and just think about myself? So for this I'm taking time. That is the reason I'm taking a little time to go for my feature pretty soon.
1659607490.0-1659628038.0
Another interesting thing is manasanama is not your first short film. It's not the first time doing attempting a short film. So what thing changed between the previous ones and manasanamaha? Do you think something changed? Yeah, my very first short film was WTF what the Fact.
1659628124.0-1659644534.0
The film is called what's the fact? So it's my very first mist, very amateur. I made it in 2013. I just had like basic camera rigged and gear, which I just took on. I didn't know how to shoot a film.
1659644582.0-1659655546.0
Nothing. I haven't had any idea. I just had theoretical experience. I'm a great fan of Stanley Kubrick and Hitchcock. So I've been inspired by these two.
1659655568.0-1659677620.0
Filmmakers have inspired me a lot as I started watching the films and they didn't understand how to edit a shot, how to edit a film, how to shoot, how to light and all I've just learned from them, theoretically. But the very first film also had just basic idea about I don't know if you have watched it, it's a 30 minutes film. It could have been done into an 80 film, actually. But I didn't know. I just wanted to make it in 1015 minutes.
1659677990.0-1659692994.0
But after I shouted the film, it became 30 minutes. So I rested the entire film. But then that is the first time I had a hands on experience on camera. My lenses and wigs and everything. And then I just learned basics of filmmaking, like how to make a film.
1659693122.0-1659706498.0
Then I made a film after a few years, after two, three years, I just made one more shot. And then I made a horror short film called Hide and Seek, which has done pretty well. It's a single take shot. It's a four minute single take short. It doesn't experimental.
1659706534.0-1659718180.0
By the time I just love experimenting on films. I just don't want to tell. Sometimes some people watch messages and they say, you have to eat like this. You can't eat like this. You always eat like this.
1659718550.0-1659736950.0
So it has to be so simple for the audience. But I don't know. As I told you, I need to get conviction on my stories and my story telling. I always love to experiment on stuff. So High and Seek was one such kind of shot where I was doing my masters in the US.
1659737100.0-1659753098.0
I came to India on my vacation. I just had one night of shoot, so there are few friends who were happy to help me. And I just call all my friends and actors shot the film in 4 hours, four to five years. We shot the entire film. So it took almost 28 takes.
1659753184.0-1659766962.0
28 takes. I remember it's a single shot film, so it had no cuts. So we took 28 takes and we shot it. It had sink sound and all. So then I left to US in the next, the very next, I think two to three days, I left the US.
1659767016.0-1659776398.0
Because I had to finish my masters. So then we just put it on YouTube and it. Went like a lot of people have loved it. I've got calls about, Will you make a horror film, please? Will you make a horror film?
1659776414.0-1659788502.0
We are ready to produce. Then I got a call from Sukumar Sir when I was in the US. And he texted me, and we had a call, and he's like, I loved you. A short film. It was so well done.
1659788636.0-1659802426.0
So if you want to make a horror film, I'm ready to produce. He said it was in 2017, I guess, 17 or 16. I'm 17, I guess, then. Alexa, I can't help, but I can't come to India because I'm here in the US. I have a lot of responsibilities and all that.
1659802448.0-1659821742.0
Again, he's like, I don't know. Whenever you want to come, just come and tell me a story. I'd love to produce horror film with you. He said, Then why are people people think if you make a horror shot film, they'll think like, okay, he's good at horror. So if you make a thriller shot film will offer you people will offer you a thriller film.
1659821886.0-1659844394.0
So it becomes like then when I came for good, I came back to India for good, just to make films. So I just came back to India for good. So then I didn't have any other option. I only had my whole life and whatever the money I earned so far, to put on a short film and make it so manasanama was like a life or death for me. To me, it was not like back then.
1659844432.0-1659860560.0
I used to make this Gardens of Fun. I had one night so I can shoot one film on. But man was so ambitious because my life was at stake. I didn't know where to go. If it didn't work, I would have gone back to the US and I would have been posting my It job right now.
1659862290.0-1659876178.0
That is what I put everything on it by luck. I don't know if it's worked for me. So that's the reason I put my entire effort on it. And it's paying me back. It's paid me back.
1659876344.0-1659877060.0
Right?
1659879130.0-1659899082.0
One of the most common ways for people to get into filmmaking is to assist someone. Did you ever consider assisting anybody as an Ad on their films? No. Actually, I tried back then. In 2013, I made my first Short term WTF because RGV Ramapalano wanted me to make it.
1659899136.0-1659912218.0
Because when I back then, I was a huge fan of RGB service. So I left, and I left him an email saying, yes, sir, can I can I please assist you? I don't have anything in life. I'm so mad for him to please. Then he replied me, saying, like, Come to Mumbai.
1659912314.0-1659925074.0
We'll just sit and chat about it. So I went to Mumbai and we sat, and he's like he said, no, don't assist me. Assisting is the worst job ever done. Because assisting is not a creative job. At all, I think you are creative enough.
1659925112.0-1659932930.0
So what? You make a short film, make a demo film. If I like it, I'll produce a film. Then I made WTF. Actually, he was a WTF.
1659933010.0-1659941398.0
My very first film. I wasn't content, but he's liked it. He's like, okay, now write a script or something. We'll produce a low budget film. So that's how I got my opportunity.
1659941484.0-1659957040.0
Then when he said that it is not a creative process at all, so he said like my 80s over a year. They just work because they want contacts or they want something else. But if you're creative enough, never work as an 80. That's what he told me, that he was the first person to tell me that. Then.
1659957570.0-1659984726.0
I never thought about assisting someone after that because I've learned filmmaking from YouTube. Like watching YouTube tutorials websites and hands on experience I've already got because a lot of my friends are interface. So then my family wasn't so happy for me to be here because they were pretty scared about what will happen for your future. You don't have contacts, you are not making money. How will you survive or not?
1659984748.0-1660016170.0
So they asked me to send me to you. I just took my grie and I went there to pursue my masters in engineering again. So after I finished it, I got a call from Shaker Kamla's team because they were shooting a film called Sidai Paul Premium Religion. When I was doing masters, like, I used to watch Premium every day. I used to be a huge fan of Muller.
1660016330.0-1660029446.0
Then I got another I got a call and I didn't know about Fida. I think they have shot half of the film already. Half of the film has been shot in India. So they were coming to us to shoot the second half. Then they're like, we need someone who knows Texas pretty well.
1660029468.0-1660041866.0
So all my life, my two years I have spent in Texas. Like Houston, Austin. Yeah. So my masters I've done from Houston. So then they wanted someone who knows geography, Texas geography, pretty well.
1660041968.0-1660057178.0
And they almost wanted a first Ad. Because it's not just an Ad job. Production assistant, art direction and everything. Because they were pretty less crew. The crew was only ten people that I think hardly ten from India, including the director and the DOP.
1660057354.0-1660070162.0
So then I was like, okay, Sai Palavi is doing this film, so I should go over conceptual. So then I went. Then I met Palawi. So we had almost a 36 day schedule there. So I don't see it as a creative job or process.
1660070216.0-1660090106.0
Something like a creative process or something. But after working on the film, then I got to understand, okay, this film, this is how televisions are done. So I was just scared. I was just scared and ran away to us because I wasn't sure. So then I understood this point and I didn't even tell my my mom for one week.
1660090128.0-1660101258.0
I just sat after they went to India, I just sat in my room and I was like, what am I doing here? I can actually give my shot. I have to go back to India. Maybe if I tell my mom, she will not be okay. If I tell my brother, he won't be okay.
1660101344.0-1660117166.0
So what I'll do is I just booked my ticket and took my luggage and came back to India. Yeah, I just came to India. So my mom just asked me like, did you come to vacation or did you come for good? I'm like, I'm sorry, I came for good. What do you do here?
1660117268.0-1660132310.0
If I want time, I want to make films. Then she's like, now you are matured enough, there's no point. You do whatever you want, but don't depend financially on me. Okay, I won't depend on you, but let me try. Realistic approach.
1660132890.0-1660152640.0
Yeah, it's pretty realistic. That's how I came back. I think assisting for Fida has helped me in this way. It just helped me in a way where I just took my passion. Otherwise I would have been in US.
1660153170.0-1660168400.0
I would have been doing my job or something. So when you think back to all of this recently I saw the post that you had posted about receiving, about your experience.
1660170470.0-1660178420.0
Do you have a mentor relationship? What makes this special for you?
1660186410.0-1660199914.0
Can you hear me? Yeah. Basically I'm a huge fan of Sukmar SA. I watched Arya when I was twelve years old. I was full and I watched Arya and I was like blown away like this.
1660199952.0-1660216574.0
I haven't seen a film like that which is commercially viable. And also psychologically, it affected me psychological. He says I love you and he says, like, I hate you. He's also as good as I love you. Because I have something she had some feeling on me, feeling like it affected me.
1660216692.0-1660233974.0
I was a kid, but back then I used to analyze I started analyzing that film. The only two filmmakers that has two thirds of filmmakers that have heavily inspired me was one was RGB and one was RGB's film. As I told you, I'm a great horror fan. I love his horror films. Actually.
1660234012.0-1660255498.0
I don't know if people like him, but I love his horror films. After that, Arya has affected me a lot. And I always wanted to reach out to him after I came to as a fan, but I never got a chance. So when he's a hide and seek, we had a call. But after that he has a habit of changing his phone number every two or three months.
1660255664.0-1660278878.0
He never made in the same corner. So I've lost his number. So as soon after I tried to get his contact, I couldn't get so I missed that opportunity after that and after I made Mansanama, I tried to reach out to him. The very first person I wanted to show Mansama was Sukmasa. So I made it and I was like for three or four months I was like I had this film in my pentrak and hardly I used to meet every person in the film.
1660278894.0-1660298330.0
I was like can you show it to Sukma please? He can show it to Sum, can you show it to Sukhmas? But some people actually tried to get me there actually reached Sukmasa before it was put out to the public. But unfortunately he couldn't watch it because he was pretty busy and he didn't know it was it. Somebody has made a shot and please watch it like that.
1660298400.0-1660316430.0
Somebody has given him the link or something. But unfortunately he didn't watch it somehow so soon after we put it out during pandemic director Chris was the first person to call me. Chris texted me and he's like my watch your film. It is so well done. I wanted to reach out to you.
1660316500.0-1660326238.0
I was not finding your number. He called me at midnight at 02:00 or something. I was like I was shaking like why is there a Chris calling me? What is he going to do? I wash it tomorrow.
1660326334.0-1660353580.0
Where are you doing? I've heard like you're doing if somebody has signed me and I said no, I haven't signed for anyone but yeah, some people are asking me to make then sir, I'll ask you only one small favor please, if you have any chance, please show it to Sukhmar sir. I said please connect me to Sukumar sir, I want to show it to them. You wanted to show it to Sumar, just give me two minutes and immediately that same night Sukhmasar was also awake at the same time. So he connected me to Sukhas and Sukhasa spoke to him.
1660354030.0-1660379726.0
He didn't watch the film for the next one week because Sukmas was very close friend has passed away and he was not in a good but he left me a long text saying rebuke, I got your film but unfortunately I couldn't watch it. I just watched the first 1 minute and something as distracted me. I had to go on my work but now I'll watch it. Please give me a week. I am now morning on my friend's death he said after one week he was a film and he car he left me in a huge sticks.
1660379838.0-1660395414.0
This is one of the most brilliantly made films that I've seen and it's so well done. Let me know after you wake up, we'll have a call. He said I woke up at 10:00, he watched it at midnight, at five and then we had a call. We had a long call of two or something then Alexa really do you remember me? We spoke in 2017.
1660395462.0-1660409226.0
Then I tried to I'm trying to contact that is a horror film. I remember that horror film. It happens in a Bangladesh and this guy is a legal texture sorry, in the same way. How the heck can you do this? And that was a horror film.
1660409258.0-1660417054.0
This is a romance film. You redefined horror in there and you refined. Sorry, it never works like this. I'm not a genre based filmmaker. Idea has to excite me.
1660417092.0-1660424514.0
Then I make films like this. Then he was so happy. And I'm a biggest fan. I'm trying to reach out to you. And this is what it is.
1660424552.0-1660447798.0
From then until today, Sukumara talks to me like every possible time. Whenever I text him or call him, he's always been a mentor since then. Before that, I never had before I made Manasanama, I never had any film contracts or connection. So it's all after Mansanama then. Sukmar sir is like my mentor is like a god to me to be ranked whenever I want to make him.
1660447804.0-1660464590.0
Sir, please listen to my story. I'm thinking to do this, sir, this is what it is. I need your suggestion. So tell me when I can meet you so soon after I got guineas, I think the only person who was happier than me after I got guineas was super. Because I didn't even put it to pressure public or anywhere.
1660464930.0-1660471314.0
I just took the photograph and send it. Texted him. Amazing. This is super wire. Did you send it to Press?
1660471432.0-1660480694.0
No, sir, I didn't send it to Press. But I just want to meet you. Yeah, come down. He's very busy with working on pushpatu right now. But he just called me that night itself.
1660480732.0-1660492550.0
And he's like, we have to send it to Press case. And I call Press on that. I don't need press. I just wanted to take your blessings. So I'm here.
1660492700.0-1660505502.0
Then he's like, this is Guinness. How many people will hit this in this world? Nobody is like, very less. I'm very proud of you. We had a whole lot of chat, including both this thing and also about the script that I'm doing right now.
1660505636.0-1660511310.0
So we had a huge conversation that night. So he's like, now I can say he's my mentor.
1660514180.0-1660517060.0
Won't I take any step in my life without letting him know?
1660519910.0-1660548602.0
Coming out of filmmakers, like as a filmmaker, which actors performances moved you? Which actors are you hoping to cast in your future films? I'm not asking about the next one, but in general, about your future films. Do you have a vision about your next 25 years? So I'm pretty sure I never write something keeping someone in my mind, my character, whatever.
1660548656.0-1660566490.0
I write my stories and my characters. When I feel the product is that I create the leads and all, I just create something out of my personal experiences. So I don't think about casting my age for who are Prabhas or something. A lot of people say like, you are Prabhas and why don't you write a story for Prabhas? I don't know.
1660566500.0-1660572450.0
I can't write like that. I will write something if I think it is close to it's an action film. It has so much of heroism.
1660581130.0-1660583000.0
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.
1660586010.0-1660600380.0
I think when you switch the pods, that part muted out. Sorry, can't hear you. I'm good. Yeah. It would balance me.
1660601950.0-1660620626.0
Actually, I like almost most of the access. I'm a great fan of Prabas. As I told you, my long term goal would be working with Prabhas. Maybe in future five years, I don't know. And I like Bilkar Salman as an actor who is pretty good.
1660620728.0-1660639910.0
I love his acting and I love Mahesh Prabhu if I get an opportunity like stars if I want to work with Mahesh Prabhas. So I love Junior India. He's pretty good. They are all great because they are good actors. And I like all of them.
1660640060.0-1660657246.0
And particularly if you ask me, a great F sharp Khan. He's one of the greatest actors that I've ever seen. And also equally good as a star. So he's like the best. If there is a dream that I would want to work with, it will be SRK, right?
1660657428.0-1660661630.0
So what about female actors? When it comes like, you've listed all male actors.
1660663970.0-1660678818.0
I used to love Vidya Balan a lot. I'll definitely like to cast her. If there is a role for her, I would love to work with her. And female actors, I'm not Palavi. I like Palavi a lot.
1660678904.0-1660690626.0
She's she's pretty good. She's one of my favorite actresses. There's like few actors that I keep in mind when I write characters. One among them is Palavi, for sure. She's a gym.
1660690738.0-1660697318.0
She's very talented. As I've already worked with her. I've assisted PIDA. I know how it works. It was like her very first film.
1660697334.0-1660705690.0
Next second film maybe. Muller was a very short role. Pita was a full feature. I think that was her first in Telku.
1660708610.0-1660720370.0
Yes. She's only done a Premium before. But premium is not like a full length film character. But SIDA was a full length. And I also like Rashmi Kamandana.
1660721190.0-1660722770.0
She has her own style.
1660726310.0-1660756238.0
She has pretty own style that I like. I like a lot of actors who bring their own style into the character so they can do one that's like Pawan Kalyanza. Pawanzar is like no matter what it is, you can see the energy and style like a lot of actors like that. Tamil if you want to talk, if you want to ask, kamalzar is my favorite actor. And all of the actors are talented actually.
1660756324.0-1660768498.0
But if you ask, Kamalza is my favorite because Mansanama was inspired from Manmade Nambu, the song that's been shown. Right. Okay. Now I see the connection. Okay.
1660768584.0-1660779934.0
Yes. I tried to send it to Kamal Sarah a lot. I tried every chance of me, like every Tamil guy who called me. I even asked GovaM sir. Gautam, sir presented it in Tamil.
1660779982.0-1660791718.0
Gotamraga. Then I asked him. When I spoke to like Sir, I want to show it to only two people. It was only three people. You were the first person you watched it and you are dumping it.
1660791724.0-1660802986.0
I'm very happy. So I want to show it to Manhirtanzar and Kamala Sansar. He said he'll show, but I don't know if it has happened. It has happened very long back. It's been more than it's almost a year.
1660803088.0-1660816394.0
But I think it didn't happen. But I try after that also, whichever Tamil person spoke to, please show it at Kamasar. Because it is completely inspired by his idea. His idea of making this song from one mother number nila Wanam. Nila.
1660816442.0-1660831082.0
So that's where in 2009, I guess I was doing my bathroom. First year, first year, second year. Then I was a film. And I told my friend my friend recently told me when I was like, this is song. This song is so brilliant.
1660831166.0-1660842840.0
When I get an opportunity, I'll make a film like this. That's what I told him. That's what my friend told me. I think two months back, he said then I was like, oh, this is so psychologically. It sad in my mind.
1660843950.0-1660859802.0
Yeah, that is the reason. It's completely inspired from me. Okay, so this will be my last question. I want to ask you about making films beyond Telugu. Right now, people are making films making multilingual films.
1660859866.0-1660879118.0
People are making dubbing films in different languages. So what is your opinion on making films in a different language? Like say Ramshi Padapali is working with Vijay. So what do you think about working in different languages as a director? I don't think film as a language.
1660879294.0-1660893782.0
I never thought about film as a language. Because film for me is a visual medium. I don't care if it is dialogue. I'm a kind of a director who has very less dialog in his film. If you see even one son of very less dialogue, the dialogue is pretty less a 60 minutes film.
1660893846.0-1660910814.0
You barely have a two to three minute dialogue in the entire film. So I work like that. And one person who told me I should never get confined to Telugu or a single language is Gautham sir. The Gautam sir, when he said like, are you making the film in Tamil feature in Thumb sir? I don't know.
1660910852.0-1660920946.0
My strength is writing in Telugu. I don't even know Telugu. But Telugu people watch my films. Why do you even confine yourself making films into one language? So never do that then.
1660921128.0-1660938200.0
Yeah, it's right. Then I started. So even stories that I write, I don't keep in mind saying I should write in Telugu. I don't do that. So my ideology itself is like the kind of stories and characters I construct and write.
1660939530.0-1660968210.0
They work in every other language. I don't keep in mind doing that. But it happens like that. Even if you want to see Pushpa as a film which is completely which is completely regional, which is being made in theupathy and the background is Thirupati and the region, the slang and everything is completely taken from roots of Chandragiri and Thirupati and the forest shehasalam shehasaram forest. But it's been washed all over the world.
1660968360.0-1660994038.0
It's an even bigger hit in Hindi than in Telagu. So I think your script and your writing and the way you make films need to have that aspect of reaching it to different audience. I think that's what I believe in. I don't particularly write to make it in Telugu or Tamila or something. Whatever I write, I'll keep it in mind that it can be made in any language.

All of my films are like that. All of the stories that I've written so far can be made in any languages. But the only thing is can you see mass? For example, Pushpa was a mass like mass. So it had the chance of there was too much of action and all that.

That is like a lot of people. But when you make dramas or romance films or something which have been done so many times and those kind of films might not be like by other languages because they'll have their own style of regional. Like, I see Tamil films. I see a lot of Tamil films. When I see some romantic comedies in Tamil, I don't think they can be I'll enjoy them as Tamil films, as Tamil romance films.

But some films in Telugu I watch some romance Telugu films. I think they only work in Telugu. So the kind of plot, the kind of family drama they put to make it a little better and there's a lot of culture and all. So some films can have culture to be rooted in them. Like, for example, karnan.

I love Karnan. I loved Karan. I loved asuran So the culture is pretty much rooted in the stories itself, the characters and all. And I can't expect them to be in other languages because the language spoken and also the body languages of the actors, the traditions and everything, it has to be watched as it's a Tamil film. You'll still love the film no matter what.

Even a Singapore guy or a US guy watches Asuran, he'll still love the film. But I don't think that film can be w to English, right? Like Asuran can be watched in English or watched in other languages. That kind of films have to be like that. You can't change them.

But when you make films like fantasy action films like KZF, RRR these kind of films I think can be made in any language. It depends on how high concept they are.
1661117350.0-1661132260.0
But I personally write all my films that can work in other languages too. Wonderful. Thank you so much for this lovely conversation. I am looking forward to hear from you about your feature film soon.

1658658850.0-1658693006.0
Hey, it's great to have you here and I think it's a great day to talk because we've just seen Nira Chopra win a silver medal at the World Athletics Championship. I just want to kind of put the premise there laid out for people to understand. You know, I've got a few calls in the morning from sports buffs and sports lovers and we all very genuine people saying, alexa, our Olympic gold KBAs is a golden ageita. But I just want to say that after an Olympic gold to win a silver at the World championship, athletics World Championship, which in many cases can be more difficult, it's a real deal. So this is an incredible athlete that we are talking about.
1658693108.0-1658701460.0
He's the pride and joy of India. So I'm going to set the ball rolling. We are going to discuss the upcoming Commonwealth Games. But I want to set the ball rolling. Me here.
1658702070.0-1658733882.0
Let me just first reintroduce me here. Vasabara he is the assistant editor of Sports of the Indian Express. He's been an old colleague of mine when he's still a very young man, but he started out very early with me, I think. And I would say he's an authority on sports, which is everybody does cricket, but he does a lot of these non cricket things, largely hockey, football and Olympic discipline, like what we are watching now. So, Mail, first things first, what did you expect from Nirach today?
1658733936.0-1658750580.0
Did you expect a gold medal or a podium finish or what? First of all, thank you for your very kind words, sir. It's a pleasure to be in. And also, my apologies. Clearly I'm not as tech savvy as I should be.
1658752950.0-1658793146.0
We're all learning. But to answer your question, to be honest, I know many people will say he a bold rap, but yesterday, me and a couple of other colleagues at Express, we had assumed it would be a silver because it was always going to be tough for Neeras to go for gold because of Anderson Peters. Now, the grenadian athlete has been at a very, very high level throughout the last 20 after the Tokyo Olympics. It's very interesting because Peters and Neeraj, the career has almost gone simultaneously. They competed together at the youth level at the last Commonwealth Games.
1658793178.0-1658817960.0
Neders defeated Anderson Peters at Tokyo. Anderson Peters didn't even qualify for the final. And after that he's just taken off. He's throwing 90 plus meters at every competition they have taken part in. And it was interesting because soon after his silver medal in perhaps just coming pressure off NIDA's press conference, and that was the first thing, neither acknowledged as well, that Anderson Peters has been throwing at a very high level.
1658818410.0-1658839310.0
He doesn't know what his secret is, but it's always going to be tough for nearest to beat Anderson Peters unless his level would have fallen. Very impressive. If I may just quickly add for Neeraj that he showed the ability to come back after a poor start. Until now. He had settled the matter in the first one or two throws in wherever he has completed this time.
1658839380.0-1658856418.0
He lacked behind after the first three throws and showed the ability to deal with the pressure to get that throw in the fourth attempt onwards. And he did that pretty well, I guess. Yeah. So this is interesting. I want to touch on this.
1658856504.0-1658876286.0
So we've seen Niraj, or whatever we've seen of him so far. He's been on the international circuit for a couple of years, even before the Tokyo Olympics. But we've seen him. He's a guy with a swag. He comes first, throw me 85, 88, whatever, and then he's got a shot of a medal.
1658876418.0-1658895258.0
That seems to be the image that one has got in mind, that he's a guy who demolishes the opposition. But here what we've seen. He's shown resilience, he's shown the ability to dig deep. He realized he was in trouble having fouled his first throw. And then Peter is going on for 90 plus 90 plus throw.
1658895274.0-1658928860.0
Then you're on the back foot, so to speak, and you have to you have to show your metal from that situation to come and get a silver. I thought it was a commendable achievement. Because what happens is, if a person becomes a gold medalist and it's happened with all, there are freaks like the same bolt who you have to keep out, but somebody wins a gold. Then every time you expect gold from that person, which may not be always possible, especially in track and field, which is, if I might say it's, ultra competitive. So I thought Neeraj today was actually one of my admiration even more for the way he came back.
1658929870.0-1658981180.0
Absolutely. And we also have to be kind of conscious of the fact that Neeraj, even though he's the Olympic champion, there is an immense potential for him to grow. I mean, he is yet to touch the 90 meters mark which current crop of top javelin throws have managed repeatedly. We have to be aware that if Neeraj going forward in next year's World Championship or in Paris Olympics, if he has to remain in that contention, he'll have to improve further and get that 90 meters mark. Having said that, despite not really going that far and touching 90 meters, the fact that he already has an Olympic gold, he has a gold championship silver shows the kind of champion he is and the mental ability he has, like you rightly pointed out today, to be behind the pack for such a long time.
1658981550.0-1659002638.0
He was talking about the conditions, the headwind, which made things difficult not just for him, but others. I mean, Anderson Peters was competing in a different planet, but for all others, the headwind was a problem neither. She was facing some other technical issues as well. So despite all those troubles, the fact that he could come up with a throw, which won him silver, I think was very commendable. Fantastic.
1659002734.0-1659014246.0
And the Commonwealth Games coming up, so we'll probably see him there again. Both these assets. Both of them. Yeah. Neera kind of after the fourth row, he had some pain.
1659014348.0-1659026518.0
He was heavily. Did he say anything in the press conference about whether he's going to the Commonwealth Games? Not going. How is he feeling? He didn't mention whether he'll be going to the Commonwealth.
1659026534.0-1659038526.0
I mean, as of now, he's going to the Commonwealth Games. He said that basically right now his body was warm. So when he wakes up tomorrow morning, he'll just see what kind of pain he is in. But he felt okay. He said, I'm not feeling that much pain right now.
1659038548.0-1659049134.0
For strapping, it was okay and it shouldn't be a problem. So fingers crossed. Now, Peters is from Grenada. Is that right? What is it about Caribbean athletes?
1659049182.0-1659081254.0
I mean, for about 20 years or 25 years, we assumed that the Caribbean athletes were sprinters. Ben Johnson, Hussain Bowl, so on. Blake and all kinds of terrific athletes have come from there, including in the women's section. Now we've got even a Jambulance role coming from there. What's happening and why, I want to juxtapose it as to what you there's so much to learn from Jamaica, for India, it's a tiny little nation and is now winning more medals than India.
1659081302.0-1659097582.0
It's not about I'm not talking about India. We won medals at the Olympics and we are on the upward spiral, I would think. But what is it in countries like Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados and Granada that is making them? Is it something to do with the genes? Is it to do with training?
1659097636.0-1659129850.0
Is it to do with sports medicine or what? I think it's a combination of all things. In the case of Anderson Peter, specifically, I think it would be a case where success breeds success in the sense that there were no javelin throwers of this level before him. Similar to the case with Neeraj, but in Granada. It's interesting because it wasn't really up there with Jamaica or Barbados or many of the Caribbean island until Kirani James printer came forward and he kind of raised the bar over there.
1659130000.0-1659165122.0
And his repeated success, I guess, also inspired the following generation of athletes. And they have an athletic culture, even though they were not winning big, perhaps as much as Jamaica, but they had a great athletic culture, track and field culture. Again, very similar to Neeraj. Both, in fact, Peters and Neeraj have very similar backgrounds in that they come from villages where javelin wasn't freely there. Niraj started kind of doing it for his own fitness to lose weight, apparently to lose weight, he was overweight and he was sent to the stadium.
1659165186.0-1659188490.0
Just he shed some kilos. He was a very subjugated boy from North India, from Punjab. Andyana right. I think the youngest in the family and in the case of Kirani James, it was again similar family situation. He grew up aiming stones at targets and very basic infrastructure.
1659190030.0-1659213540.0
And this is something that Niraj also pointed out right now at the press conference. It's the fact that javelin throw is a sport has moved on from Eastern European dominance. There was a Czech Republic guy on the podium today, right? But it has moved on from the Eastern European dominance and spread across the world. I mean, to have on podium a guy from Granada finishing on top and then from India, it's something that we wouldn't have had.
1659214310.0-1659252370.0
Let me hold your thoughts on here. Just a reminder to whoever has joined us, or we'll see it later that this is the Sports Hub with ayas mehman. And I've got with me as my guest today, Mirror Basa RA, who is the assistant at the sports of the Indian Express, and I'll repeat it again, he's an authority on sports beyond cricket. Many people, everybody writing on cricket in India or speaking about it, but Mirror is authority on hockey, football and obviously the Olympic discipline. So just to ask you to hold your thoughts there that you've got on the podium a guy from Granada who is a gold medal winner and silver medalist is from India.
1659252950.0-1659283402.0
So Kirani James had opened up a whole new dimension for sports pursuits in Granada. You think Niraj, after his exploits in Tokyo and obviously now after what's happened in Oregon, is going to have is having the same impact, I think my opinion is that he's opened up whole new vista for Indian sports, not just in javelin, but sports in general. That Yam Karak Chair we can be the best in the world. Not just that. I mean, we can be the best in the world.
1659283456.0-1659306766.0
And with such aura, with such dominance, I think bo Kafi Bhadak mindset shift. That's something. Bond Star you look at him, the way he walks, the way he talks. He's got the bearing of a superstar near a Jordan and obviously then he's got a gold medal and now a silver medal. So it just becomes so much more heftier in terms of persona.
1659306958.0-1659338782.0
Yeah. In fact in fact, I'll slightly make a story, plug a story written by my colleague, Neal Koshi. It's just up. It basically focuses on the kind of grind that Nero Chopra is wearing to and it says a lot about his personality. So Neraj's Coach, his physio, they all have been saying one thing that if you tell him a certain thing that he has to do, say for example, after the Olympics, he was on this big worldwilled tour of the country attending interviews, endorsements and everything.
1659338916.0-1659367878.0
It was a period when he put on 14 kilos first day back at training. The physio just had to explain that why he needs to shed those kilos as soon as possible. And the process that he has to follow to do that, no questions asked. Niraj followed his program from day one, and within, I think, three weeks or so, he shed all those extra kilos and he was back to his physical fitness. And that's the great thing about him.
1659367964.0-1659391854.0
His coach, Barton, is he has played such a positive role. We talk about Niraj's mindset. I think a lot of it stems from his coach's attitude as well, because every time Neeraj steps on the field, his coach always tells him just one thing you go out there and enjoy. Don't worry about medals or anything. We have trained, we have worked towards a certain thing.
1659391972.0-1659411090.0
We just try and enjoy and try and execute whatever we have worked on. There is no external talk about medals or achieving 90 meters or world records or whatever. And that casualness, I think, reflects in the way NEH performs every time he's on the field. Well, actually, he might appear casual, but he's also very intense at this level. You have to be very focused.
1659411170.0-1659435722.0
He's the second Indian athlete after Andrew Bobby George to win a medal at the World Championships. Right now, just give us a rundown as to what's been happening in these World Championships. About the other Indian athletes, there's nobody else who's finished on the podium apart from Niraj. So is that a good sign or not such a good sign? Have they bettered their previous best?
1659435776.0-1659448834.0
Are they looking promising, going ahead, and then we go to the Commonwealth Games. What to expect there, right? So quickly to wrap up the World Championship. India has achieved its expectations. What was expected of them?
1659448952.0-1659469666.0
One medal was expected. Anything else would have been a bonus. What has been a good sign is there have been six finalists, including Niraj, which is commendable. We've seen Indian athletes enter the finals in newer disciplines. So, for example, Avinash Subway in 300 meters, people chair, although he finished 11th.
1659469698.0-1659497310.0
The fact that he reached the final of that event is interesting because it opens up another new possibility for Indian athletes. Until now, there was no one in People Chase. Similarly, Moly Sri Shankar in long jump. I was slightly disappointed, although, I mean, we don't know exactly what kind of conditions he was dealing with. But had Sri Shankar kind of matched even his personal best or met the national record, he would have been around the podium or somewhere nearby.
1659497670.0-1659519330.0
So that was a slight disappointment for me. But at least he reached the final. He did better than the Tokyo Olympics, so that's another positive way to look at it. You had Anurani in the javelin throw final. She again did something which is commendable within her capabilities.
1659519410.0-1659536942.0
I think she did pretty well. What about Rohit Yadav? He was also in. Exactly right, yeah. So I was just coming to him, and I think Rohit Yadav's performance, in a way, it takes us back to your previous questions in that the impact neither just had.
1659537076.0-1659583578.0
I think it shows in this because at, say, the previous World Championships, we had no finalists in javelin throw cut now and we have two. One of them has finished on the podium and the other guy is, I think, a lot to do with the whole nearest wave that started. I think it kind of started since 2018. And we've seen the sport just pick up at an insane speed across especially Haryana, you have javelin throw nationals where hundreds of young athletes come and participate, and these are just javelin through National Championships, not the Athletics athletics National Championships. He's had an immense, amazing chosen, this.
1659583744.0-1659615826.0
So, one quick before we move on from Nerd, but I have to go back to Neerd. So in your understanding of the sport and the athlete himself, you think he's good for another decade? What is the lifespan of javelin throws apart from unforeseen injuries? Do they kind of participate in the top level in their 30s or not? So, I mean, are we looking at a 1012 year, maybe three Olympics for Neil?
1659615858.0-1659636026.0
If he maintains his body, yes. But it's also very interesting. I'm not 100% certain, but I was talking with someone about this yesterday, and we were just vaguely going through the career span of a javelin thrower. And it is interesting because neither is 24 right now. And this is when a peak of a javelin thrower kind of begins.
1659636058.0-1659649598.0
So 24 to 28, 29 is generally where javelin throws tend to do well. That's still two and two Olympics after the next two Olympic. Paris, la. Yeah, La. And two Olympics and multiple world championships.
1659649614.0-1659670550.0
Apart from the commonwealth and the Asian game. Exactly. And with every competition, Neeraj has shown us something different if not throwing further distances. Like today, he didn't kind of better his own record, but he showed us that he can come back when chips are down. Every competition, he shows us something new.
1659670700.0-1659705220.0
And I think it's an extremely exciting period for all of us. So one of the things, one team actually, which has been running on Kulki now, is Naazor Nayazore looking ahead at the next 25 years trends, people who can make an impact or people collectively. So in the field of sports, you mentioned the six athletes who are there in the World Championship, apart from including Neil, right? Yeah. So do any of them or all of them have interesting futures ahead?
1659707910.0-1659731914.0
Are they there for the next 810 years? Otherwise other athletes who you can name from the junior ranks, who I can look forward to for the next decade, maybe 15 years. So, from the current crop, I'd be very interested to see how Avinash Sabay and Morley Sri Shankar kind of developed. What are their ages now? They are in their early 20s.
1659731952.0-1659764600.0
Early 20s, okay. Yeah. And for both of them, Avina Subley, it's interesting because he started running, he started athletics because he's an army man and he was posted in Siachen and all the other difficult places in the country where where army men have to patrol and kind of stay. And he has been in those tough situations and from there he's come and taken up athletics. So I think this training, this kind of physical activity would be a child's play for him.
1659765690.0-1659796750.0
He still has a lot of scope to improve and I'd be interested to see I don't know if he'll get a medal at a world or an Olympic level but just the limit to which he can push himself. Murli Sri Shankar we have seen him kind of achieve the marks which can win you world or an Olympic medal at national level tournament. For him to translate that into international will be a challenge which he is capable of doing. And we have another very young and very upcoming long jumper called Jesuin Altrin. Right?
1659796820.0-1659829962.0
He again, Jesuin and Modi at national level have kind of annulated the entire field. They have been kind of pushing each other to such limits that it makes us all very excited. Jaswin Aldrin unfortunately could not be a part of the world championship because he didn't meet the cut off period. But he has immense potential, both of them, sri Shankar and Jeffson Altrin in long jump. I'm pushing the Commonwealth Games debate a little further down because I got two other issues or subjects that I must kind of pick your brains for.
1659830096.0-1659887882.0
One is you've talked at length about Niraj and his levels of excellence which are extraordinary and then other athletes around him who one can look forward to at the ground level and you do so much of ground level excellent ground level reporting, our coaching standards improving. I remember Vida and Raskina were mentioning to me in the context of hockey that the problem for India used to be or other countries from Asia is that the level of coaching at the junior level used to be poor and therefore by the time you reached the senior level there was something always lacking. When you compare us to the Australians or the judge or whoever else the Germans has the level of coaching improved? Is there enough being done by government bodies, sports Ministry, IOA, sports Authority of India, state associations, federations themselves? Is there a rosy picture getting better or is there something that we have to hold our head and keep cribbing.
1659888026.0-1659908446.0
After talking good things about whatever athletics we'll be going to? A slightly more disappointing note with this. We look at it from this way. Okay? The government on its end has been leaving no stone unturned when it comes to supporting the elite athletes.
1659908558.0-1659932554.0
Right? They want scheme also, which has been. So I don't think Indian athletes, if they want something and they're not getting fired and if they can justify that why they need this. I think they're getting whatever support is needed. I don't believe that the same level of support or expertise is translated to a junior level.
1659932672.0-1659935930.0
Now, then we get into this debate on who's responsible.
1659938210.0-1659957794.0
Again, I don't personally feel it should be the government doing that, although through site centers, most of our major talents have been coming through site centers. So you really can't fault them. Can they do better? Of course. I really don't think IOA is doing much.
1659957992.0-1659972680.0
They have been reduced to the role of post office wherein they just send entries for major multidiscipline events. Right. And beyond that, this time, they have. Said, we also had the resignation recently of the Iowa, the President. Right, yeah.
1659973530.0-1659983418.0
So the Iowa, there are challenges there serious challenges. Yeah. They couldn't hold National Games for the last seven years. Now they have come up. National Game has gone to Gujarat, isn't it?
1659983504.0-1659995840.0
Gujarat, yeah. It's in September, October. There are again layers to it which we won't really kind of get into. But they will be held. The National Games finally will happen as of now, yes.
1659997250.0-1660020022.0
Until they begin, it will be tough to say whether they will be held. So the IOA has a lot to do. State associations in most places are largely inactive. So that's another area where there is scope to do a lot for the federations, within their limitations, are doing a lot. Let me share some of my thoughts with you very quickly.
1660020156.0-1660038590.0
Sorry to interrupt. How much do we expect the government to do? I think actually the government should not be in the business of sports at all. For instance, the United States, which cumulatively has won the most medals in the history of the Olympics and by many miles, they don't have a sports ministry.
1660041090.0-1660067798.0
So all the federations work on their own. They go and look for sponsors. The athletes personally go and look for patrons or sponsors. I interviewed Michael Phelps for Hindustan Times, one of their leadership talks, a couple of years last year or two years back, and he's won 28 medals on his own. And he was not looking at swimming federation to fund him, support him in whatever way.
1660067884.0-1660085830.0
But he had at many states until he became the great swimmer or the greatest swimmer of all time, he had to go and look for funds himself. So that's one part. I'm not saying that we should necessarily do that, and I'll tell you why. The other extreme is the Chinese model, which is completely state driven. The government is involved in everything.
1660086000.0-1660128454.0
There are hybrid models, like the Australian, partly the British, which came up before the, I think, the 2000s Olympics. They came up with the National Lottery to support sports, which was eminently successful. All kinds of things work, but I think federations and private sponsorship, which means philanthropy or interest or passion for sports, must come. Till that comes instilled in mind, they'll go from pillar to post to look for support. And I think one way that the government can help, and I've been saying this for the last 15 years, perhaps, is that sport should be recognized as an industry.
1660128582.0-1660159714.0
So what is happening today, there are people supporting sports from the corporate sector of the industry, but they are doing it as a CSR activity. So CSR activity, it can change from year to year or from person to person. Who's in charge? I may support women's issues, I may support sports, I may support classical dancing or whatever. But if sports is designated as an industry and there are some takeaways for the industry, some benefits, then obviously you'll have long term support and substantial support.
1660159752.0-1660181180.0
That's my take. I just wanted to interject and tell you no, absolutely. And one point that you mentioned about the funding models, I think a lot can be learned from the British funding model as well, given that it won't be easy for us to move to a US model where there will be zero government funding. But in British model, where either you perform or perish. Yes.
1660181550.0-1660198770.0
I mean, if a sport isn't performing, then you kind of either I think. The government of India is doing that now. I think that the sports ministry gets a budget. So if they allocate 400 crore or 600 crore, whatever number of crore, and then there is a certain kind of fee. It happened with football.
1660199910.0-1660220514.0
Yes. In the last four years, funding has come down from 30 crows to five crows. That's a good system, but it should be followed diligently a picnic for some sports federations or some associations or some disciplines and not for others. Absolutely. Let's move on quickly to the Commonwealth Games.
1660220642.0-1660240510.0
How are you seeing the picture? Is it now, tell me, is it Rosie or it's not Rosie. No, it is Rosie. Connor Games is one event where Indian athletes tend to do pretty well. Of course, in some sports, level of competition isn't really as high as any other world level competition.
1660240850.0-1660257010.0
Say, for example, wrestling to a certain level. Shooting, of course, but shooting isn't there anymore. So we'll see. Last time we won, I think, 16 medals and shooting from the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. So you straight away remove those 16 medals.
1660257750.0-1660289214.0
But there is still a lot to look forward to, a lot of subplots. Even in wrestling, for example, if the medals no medal is easy, but it's relatively easy to win the medal there. But if you look beyond the medals, I'd be very interested to see how Vinesh Forgot returns to Matt after the Tokyo Olympics, where she had a tough time. Sakshi Malik, after winning the Rio Olympics, she has gone up and down in her career. She returns after a very long time.
1660289252.0-1660301410.0
Again, those are the surveillance I'll follow there. There's so much to look forward to in this badminton. Like you mentioned, they're very good prospects for medals there. What other disciplines? Boxing, resting, you think?
1660301480.0-1660315320.0
Yeah. Neil, we won't discuss I mean, if he's there, a podium place is more. It'Ll be nearer versus Anderson Peters again. So we'll just keep it there and I think that's it.
1660319770.0-1660328618.0
But I think he finished six or seven studio or something. I don't know. He finished, I think, fifth or 6th. Again. He did pretty well because Tokyo Games as well.
1660328704.0-1660340410.0
He was quite similar again. Shadi also came back from behind and finished high today. NEA has had a couple of good words to say about him as well. They're quite pally, isn't it? They're very pally.

In fact, I remember if I can share a small anecdote quickly. At the Tokyo Olympics, while they were going from the Games village to the competition venue, asha and Nera sat next to each other on the bus. And they were going through their old photos of competing together at the Commonwealth Games, at youth events, and just talking about all those memories. And Nirat speaks very fondly of him. And same with her shade.
1660367122.0-1660382810.0
I think they are very fond of each other. You know it better than most because you've been so active as the ground level and international events. There's nothing which unifies people diverse going through this horror patch. The guys who spoke up in the support included Babar Azam.
1660384990.0-1660418120.0
That's such a great gesture. Such a great gesture. So let's quickly, because we've got about ten minutes, so we need to get the Commonwealth Games disciplines, apart from badminton, wrestling, boxing, track and field, to an extent. Can you name some people that we should all look out for, apart from Niraj and Steve Shinzu? I would imagine Luxis at Commonwealth case, it will be very interesting because, again, if we are looking at the next champion, shooting isn't there.
1660419290.0-1660459560.0
Yeah, it's not there in boxing. It'd be interesting to see how Nickel Zareen builds on her World Championship medal, because formula games boxing is pretty tough. So in boxing, I'd really look for NICAR Zarine, I look for squash, which isn't a usual multidisciplinary event sport, but over here it'll be very interesting because Joshna China, Padika Palacus or of Goshal, who have been kind of holding for the last almost 20 years, this might be the last Commodore Game. Right. These are people talk about the previous 25 years now, also when we're looking ahead, because they've been such contributors absolutely.
1660461210.0-1660475654.0
For the country over the last 20 years. Yeah. And and so squash, we we'd have three of them. PT at Connor games again is one of India's strengths. And in that I'd go for satyan.
1660475702.0-1660497898.0
Satyanji very brainy player. He kind of always likes to push his limits. He's unlike a lot of young Indian athletes in that he thinks a lot how to improve his game, looks at others. He's been doing very well of late. So Satyan and of course, Manika Bhatra, she won, I think, four medals at the previous Commonwealth Games.
1660497994.0-1660518440.0
No reason she can't repeat that performance again. So PT. We have that hockey, I'll be biased because that's a sport I really like. And both teams, the men and women's team, finished fourth at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. So for them, it is a big challenge to kind of move forward and improve on that finish.
1660520010.0-1660545466.0
I must put you a little under the scanner here. So we had a fourth place for women's in Tokyo and we had a medal finish for the men's team. But at the junior ranks, you see a lot of bubbling, rich talent like we've got in cricket. We may not win we didn't win the T 20 World Cup or even the World Test Championship, but, you know, Indian cricket is flush with talent. What is the scene now in hockey, men's and women's?
1660545498.0-1660577866.0
Quickly hockey. We saw the Junior World Cup for both men and women in the last eight months, and there is undoubted potential in women's team. For example, you have got players like Mumtaz Khan, the forward, who kind of she was so good at the Junior World Cup, the kind of forward that we've been missing in the women's team. So you have someone like Mumtaz Khan in the forward line. You have very young players, again, like Salima The, who is one of the fastest players in world hockey right now.
1660577888.0-1660597582.0
She's in the way, she runs with the ball, Lalgan Siami. She's been around for so long that you forget that she's just 21 or something. So it's incredible that you have a player like her as well. There was a young defender named Mishika Chaudhry. She is from Goalier, inspired by the whole generation of Rami and Wandana Qatari and stuff.
1660597716.0-1660633834.0
And you've got a goalkeeper called Abhudevi, who again, was very impressive in the Junior World Cup. So in every position, you have players who have the potential to become stars over the next few years. And it's similar with the men's team, where you've got a lot of young players who have already transitioned to the senior team and are challenging the established order in the sense that all the senior players, they are watching their back right now. Oh, fantastic. I must remind you that there's another team sport that is going to be played in the Commonwealth Games, which is cricket, where the women's cricket team, led by Harman Priest or is going to be there.
1660633872.0-1660638490.0
You fancy their chances? Remember, they're going to play Australia, South Africa, pakistan.
1660640910.0-1660656606.0
I'd put you under the standard now. What do you think? Well, I think actually they've got a reasonably good chance. I think that they were in good form. These players have looked very impressive to me and I think there's a point for them to prove, especially when it comes to a team like Australia.
1660656638.0-1660676600.0
Remember, the Australian women's cricket team is formidable. It's more formidable than the men's team. They've had massive success over the past 810 years, even more 15 years more than the men's team. But even so, I think India has got a reasonably good chance podium finish, I certainly see. So that's one thing that I'm looking forward to.
1660677770.0-1660692174.0
The last question to you is that what was the number of metals we got the last time upon the Games? I don't remember, but it was 60. All right. Yeah. I can just check.
1660692212.0-1660702980.0
I have it somewhere. We had a rush of medals in 2018. I don't want to figure I'm saying. Do you think we have 56 medals. Will be better than you think?
1660703430.0-1660716680.0
Or do you think we'll hover around the same spot? Because it gives in some way an index as to whether we've gone up or not. It's very plain manual way of looking at it. But what do you think?
1660720640.0-1660724830.0
I think we are about to end. Our time is running out. My apologies again.
1660727840.0-1660763930.0
Mihi camera has kind of switched off, but we've had him here. It's been wonderful, as I mentioned earlier at the start, that he's a fount of knowledge and information and facts and factoids and analysis and what have you. So it's been absolutely reverting talking to me here and I'll go with him that the sports scene in India is looking fairly encouraging. There's the national game going to happen in Gujarat, hopefully, and then there will be the Commonwealth Games, hopefully we'll do oh, yeah, and made it back. I was just singing your praises again.
1660764780.0-1660779680.0
Sorry. Thanks a lot for your analysis, your interpretation of sporting trends and all that. Now I'm going to take a commitment out of you. So we've talked about Nyador and what is doing till August 15. Now, the Commonwealth Games end on August 8, right.
1660779830.0-1660814588.0
So in the week after that, at some stage I'm going to reinvite you or invite you again and we take of what's happened at the Commonwealth Games and look at athletes who we find or you find very promising going ahead for the Asian Games next year, the Olympic Games in 2024, right? Yeah. And, and, and in the future, I mean, you know, just looking ahead, as I said, the young athletes can India become a sporting nation is my big question. It's not so easy. It's a very grand vision that one can have.
1660814674.0-1660834016.0
But these are building blocks. So if you start building the blocks now, we'll be reached somewhere towards well, maybe it doesn't happen overnight. So thanks a lot for being on the show me here and as I mentioned that I will call you again. On I'd be very happy. But just a lot from you.
1660834038.0-1660857876.0
Yes. No, you asked me a question in my connection kind of wayward about the medal predictions just from the last Commonwealth Games. To answer that question, I think it will be tough because the 16 metals, India one from shooting will be removed straight away. So if we reach closer to 60 yeah, yeah. If India reaches closer to 60, I think that will be improvement.
1660857988.0-1660887644.0
Well, actually, if there's incremental, if there's an increment in, say, track and field by one metal or two medals, that in itself is a big sign or the other. If Nicaraguan wins the medal as a boxer, she'll live up to her billing, but it just kind of adds up. So I completely take your point that shooting, there's going to be a sense of slump in the middle Stallion, because it's not there. It's not the Commonwealth Games, not the fault of the Indian shooters. But fingers crossed.
1660887692.0-1660906550.0
I think that there is a lot of the good part, as you know, is you're on the show, that wherever you go now, people ask you, what is your opinion amongst a flat circle? Absolutely. And that's a good sign. That means people are becoming in India, are becoming more aware. Otherwise, earlier we always confronted cynicism, isn't it?
1660911120.0-1660928332.0
That mindset is changing. I think that's really the, for me, the crux of the matter. And I think if you kind of gone over that hump, then things can only get better from you. So, finally, thank you again. We've got about thank you so much for having me.
1660928466.0-1660928810.0
Thank you.

Hello and welcome to the first episode of Open to Question, a talk show on which you will hear the most interesting voices in the world of politics and policy, government and law. My guest today is Rajya Sabha MP Jerome Ramesh. As a former Union Environment minister who is currently the Chairman of Parliament's Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change, he is eminently suited to talk about what can only be described as a climate emergency. In 172, India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was the only head of government to have the foresight to accept the then Swedish Prime Minister Oliver Palme's invitation to a meeting that was to launch the creation of the United Nations Environment Program. Her speech there was heartbreaking and has been described as a foundation stone for much of the cooperation, disagreement and politics that would develop around climate change 50 years on.
1655461576.0-1655500214.0
At the recent Stockholm 50 plus conference earlier this month, Mrs. Gandhi's speech was again recalled at the opening ceremony. This would suggest that India is acknowledged as one of the first countries in the world to recognize the importance of preserving the environment. And yet India has been ranked last in the 2022 Environmental Performance Index released earlier this month. Jira, perhaps you could begin by explaining to us why Indira Gandhi's speech continues to resonate across the globe half a century later.
1655500352.0-1655545058.0
Well, I think it's important. She gave this speech on the 14 June 1972. So it's almost exactly 50 years ago and it's the first time that environmental issues were looked at from a developmental angle. And it's for the first time the developmental issues were looked at from an environmental angle. Till that time the environmental issue was seen to be an issue affecting only rich countries, developed countries, problems of chemical contamination, pesticides, problems of pollution and problems associated with developing countries were seen to be those associated with overpopulation.
1655545174.0-1655583222.0
This was the debate on environment till Mrs. Gandhi gave her speech. What she did was to integrate development and environment. She said there are large number of countries like India who have to create jobs, who have to industrialize, who have to urbanize, who have to raise the standard of living, but they have to do it in an ecologically sustainable manner and that without international cooperation this is simply not possible. And she also said that it's not overpopulation that is the problem.
1655583356.0-1655616782.0
It is actually over consumption. A country like the United States, for example, with 5% of the world's population accounted for almost over 30% of consumption of natural resources. So I think that's what was important about that speech. She was the only head of government other than Olaf Palme, the Prime Minister of Sweden. She spoke, she spoke about issues of pollution, she spoke about issues of deforestation, she even talked about global warming.
1655616926.0-1655645798.0
She didn't use the word climate, but she suddenly used the word global warming. And she was a naturalist. She was a conservationist by passion, by instinct, by her own life experience. So that was a defining moment in the international discourse on the environment. Perhaps the most significant part of her speech, or the one that is most quoted, had her say open quotes.
1655645894.0-1655671294.0
On the one hand, the rich look as counts at our continuing poverty. On the other, they warn us against their own methods. We do not wish to impoverish the environment any further, and yet we cannot for a moment forget the grim poverty of large numbers of people are not poverty and need the greatest polluters. Close quotes. So is poverty still the biggest polluter today?
1655671432.0-1655724818.0
No. I think what she was trying to convey, Smitha, was the fact that in India, india was still a poor country, india was an industrializing country, was an urbanizing country, and problems associated with poverty, problems associated with land degradation, lack of access to water, these are all what we don't normally consider to be traditionally environmental issues. And what she did was expand the scope of what was considered to be environmental issues. And she said it's not just pollution, it's lack of development, which affects the environment as well. And I think that's what she was trying to she was in fact, the the favorite phrase that IDRA Gandhi used throughout her prime ministership of 16 years was ecological balance.
1655724994.0-1655751658.0
This was her favorite word. And what she was trying to convey was that, on the one hand, India has to grow faster. It has to industrialize, it has to urbanize, it has to build factories. It must have higher rates of economic growth to create jobs. But at the same time, we've got to be very careful about air, about water, about land, about consumption.
1655751834.0-1655789420.0
So this balance is this fine balance between environment and development. You cannot be an eco fundamentalist, an environmentalist, but you can't be a growth fundamentalist either. You have to bring about a balance between the two. And I think the ending of her speech, where she ends the speech by quoting from the Athar Vaveda, which is a beautiful shloka, which says that you take out from the earth what you can put in. So that's balance, you compensate for what you're taking out.
1655789950.0-1655829320.0
I think she was trying to convey that in India, we are very much used to living in harmony with nature. We are very much used to respecting nature, and we could do without lectures and home elites from the developed countries, but we have to find our own answers. So I think that's what's the essence of her speech? So you don't think that a developing country like India needs to become rich before it can protect the environment? Well, I have always believed that you cannot follow the grow now, pay later model.
1655829690.0-1655862386.0
The growth now, pay later model is the model of the Americans. It's the model of the Europeans. It's certainly the model of the Chinese, which is you grow for 25 years, 30 years, and then you worry about the consequences of economic growth later. I think that luxury is simply not available to us in India particularly, it's not available to us because of a variety of reasons. Let me give you four reasons why India cannot follow the grow now, pay later model.
1655862568.0-1655866370.0
Number one, we are extraordinarily dependent on the monsoon.
1655868390.0-1655893318.0
Our economy, our agriculture, our livelihoods depends on the monsoon. So any unpredictability on the monsoon will wreak havoc on our people's lives and on the economy. That's number one. Number two, we are seeing the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers. That has implications for water supply in the north Indian rivers particularly.
1655893494.0-1655931234.0
Number three, we are seeing an increase in mean sea levels, which affects the 7500 kilometer long coastline, areas like the sundarburg, areas like goa, like Kochin in Kerala, or on the eastern coast of India. And fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, we are now beginning to see the public health consequences of what we do in terms of economic growth. People are facing problems of public health. Pollution is having a morbidity impact. It's having a mortality impact.
1655931362.0-1655973320.0
People are falling ill because of environment. People are dying because of environmental issues. So I think this luxury which other countries had later, let's have 8% of economic growth for 25 years, and we'll clean up later, or you DeForest your way to prosperity, or you pollute your way to prosperity is a luxury that India simply does not have. So we have to balance, we have to walk on both legs. We have to have economic growth, but we have to protect our environment, we have to protect our forests, we have to protect our air, we have to protect our water.
1655974010.0-1656016574.0
And as COVID-19 has demonstrated, in many ways, COVID-19 is the other side, is the public health side of environmental imbalance, the loss of biodiversity, the loss of habitats, and so on and so forth. So I think the path that other countries have followed is not a path that India can or should follow. In 1972, Mrs. Gandhi had referred to the north south problem, where she referred to the affluence of the north emerging from its domination of other countries and their resources. Since then, many people have tried to dismantle these differences.
1656016702.0-1656047738.0
How much has changed in dissolving these differences? Well, in 50 years, smita, we have a north south problem in India itself. What is the north south problem in the world? The north south problem in the world is you have a set of rich countries with high consumption and set of poor countries with lower consumption. But in the last 50 years, the remarkable progress that India has made and other countries like Brazil and China, Indonesia have made.
1656047824.0-1656088054.0
But I am speaking from the Indian perspective. In the last 50 years, we have a north south problem within our country in the sense that you have a population which is consuming as much as their counterparts in the developed countries. And you have a large majority of the population still lacking access to basic requirements like electricity, water, clean air and so on. So this imbalance, which Mrs. Gandhi talked about at the international level 50 years ago, today that imbalance is visible domestically within India.
1656088182.0-1656147470.0
We have a set of high consumption population, resource consumption population, and you have a large majority of people eking out subsistence living at low levels of per capita consumption of electricity, for example. So I think both these are important, the rich poor differential on the world stage, which Indira Gandhi talked about. But now, in addition to that, you have the rich poor differential within countries like India, which are large and populous. In 172, when the first Stockholm conference took place, there was a political declaration on the human environment that countries should limit their sovereignty so as not to harm others. In 2015, in the 2030 Agenda on the Sustainable Development Goals, countries went back to full permanent sovereignty.
1656148290.0-1656178710.0
How do you view this change? And can global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity and land degradation be solved without a more nuanced approach to sovereignty? Well, ultimately, environment is politics meta. We can talk about all we can give hype sounding phrases, we can be very romantic. Ultimately, it's a political issue, what governments can do and governments will do.
1656178860.0-1656208510.0
And this balance between environment and development is a political balance that governments work out as part of a democratic process. So at the Paris Summit in 2015, countries committed to doing things which they felt was politically acceptable domestically. No country will call for a reduction in consumption standards.
1656210870.0-1656278390.0
All elected governments particularly, will always look for higher standards of living, for a better quality of life, for consumption of electricity, for more production of automobiles, for example. So at Paris in 2015, the agreement was not a perfect agreement, but it was an agreement that was arrived at what I would say a bottom up process that every country undertook to fulfill certain obligations and commitments on the international stage, hold themselves accountable for it. And this, of course, was reiterated in Glasgow last year. So we don't have a desirable international framework today. We have an international framework which is politically acceptable, which has been negotiated among countries which countries feel they are able to sell to their domestic electorate.
1656279130.0-1656312260.0
But of course, it also means that there is a greater responsibility on the developed countries like the United States and Europe and other countries to take on a proportionately higher share of applications than developing countries like India. China, of course, is a developing country, but is responsible, is the single largest emitter. Today. 27% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China alone. India accounts for about 5%.
1656312710.0-1656334054.0
China accounts for about 27%. The United States accounts for about 15%, in the European Union for about 8%, 9% collectively. So there is a thing called climate justice. There is a thing called equity. We cannot expect countries like India to take on all the obligations and all the responsibilities.
1656334182.0-1656396490.0
Countries like the United States, countries of the European continent have to play on a greater share because they have already reached levels of development which India and China and Brazil are still aspiring to. But, you know, apart from this moral obligation on these more developed countries, what can a country like India do to persuade them to do their bit? Well, when I was Environment Minister, I always believed that we can spend all the time we can trying to hold others accountable and play the moral game. But I felt, frankly, our leadership comes from domestic actions. It doesn't come from high sounding phrases and appeal to moral conscience and so on.
1656396560.0-1656445850.0
We can do that, but ultimately we have to speak from a position of leadership. And when I was Environment Minister, when I first became an Environment Minister in 2009, I made a number of sweetness in Parliament. We had a number of debates in Parliament, and the point I made was that India has to take climate change seriously because we are most affected. We are most affected because of the monsoon, we are most affected because of the coastal areas, we are most affected because of the glaciers, we are most affected because of the forests, and we are most affected because of public health and population. So it took me a long time, and I was criticized bitterly in Parliament by many parties.
1656447090.0-1656479750.0
Some of my own colleagues in government were not convinced. But I'm glad that ten years later, twelve years later today, people have woken up to the challenge of climate change. It's not a futuristic challenge. It's a challenge that we are facing as we speak. Urban heat, for example, has become a daily feature of our lives across the country, where average temperatures in many cities has gone up by at least one to one and a half degrees Celsius.
1656480090.0-1656510930.0
And this has devastating consequences on people's lives and livelihoods. So ten years ago, we thought that we were not part of the problem, so we can afford not to be part of the solution. But my position was that we may not be part of the problem, but we certainly have to be a leader in devising a solution because it is in our interest. We are not doing anybody else a favor. We are vulnerable.
1656511270.0-1656538460.0
So we may not have emitted as much as the Americans have, or the Europeans have, or the Chinese have, but we are suffering. And there is no country in the world which is suffering as much as India is suffering, because the suffering is on multiple counts, as I mentioned to you. So that was the position I took ten years ago. I was criticized, I was attacked. But today, this is the mainstream view.
1656538910.0-1656583658.0
And I'm glad in Parliament, in government, in the media. Today, people are talking of climate change as an existential reality, not as something that will happen 20 years from now or 30 years from now. I've just come back from different parts of India where people told me I came back from Karnataka after my recent election. A number of people came and told me that their mango crop has been completely destroyed this year because of the increase in temperatures. The wheat crop this year has seen a very sharp fall because of the temperatures that have been prevailing over the last 35 to 40 days.
1656583824.0-1656611778.0
So we are already confronting the consequences of global warming and climate change. And that's why India has to be a leader. India has to walk the talk. We are experts at talking, but not necessarily experts at walking, but we have to walk the talk. So basically you're saying that irrespective of what other countries say or do, we have to take a sensible of absolutely.
1656611944.0-1656644730.0
See, the traditional Indian position has been was, at least till I became minister, that we will do things only if the developed countries give us money. We will do things only if the developed countries give technology to us. And I changed that position and I was attacked. Some of the negotiators who were part of my negotiating team themselves were critical of my position, saying, no, we must get money from the west, we must get technology from the west. And if we start doing this, our economic growth will suffer.
1656645230.0-1656664994.0
But I stood my ground and I said, no, we must do things on our own. And India is a large country. India is a resourceful country. It has the people, it has the financial resources. It can mobilize it in order to, you know, make the investments required required for dealing with climate change.
1656665112.0-1656686374.0
And the impact on economic growth is not going to be very large as was being feared. So it was a big uphill struggle for me. It was a struggle for me within government. It was a struggle for me in parliament. It was a struggle for me in the media and amongst the NGOs.
1656686502.0-1656716574.0
Many of the NGOs in India talk about climate, justice and equity and they play the guilt conscience of the Western world. And here I was minister saying, no, let's turn the spotlight on ourselves and let's do things from a position of leadership. So I think that's what I saw. For example, I made multiple visits to China and I saw the Chinese position. The Chinese position was bash the west in international forums.
1656716702.0-1656748874.0
But domestically, do all you can to make sure that you are in a leadership position. So that's the change that came about in India's position ten years ago. And I'm glad that today that position is accepted by people across the political and ideological spectrum on climate change. India has been going to the negotiations ever since these international negotiations began. India has participated in the IPCC reports.
1656749002.0-1656784054.0
Why is it that in the last 30 years india has not developed a clear plan to phase out fossil fuels and to lead the world and other renewable technologies? Well, I have been advocating that, for example, by the year 2014, india must announce that no petrol or diesel vehicles will be sold. The Europeans have announced target date of 2035. The Americans also have announced this date. And I feel it's eminently doable with the and I said this in Parliament in the last session when Mr.
1656784092.0-1656802990.0
Nathan Gutkari was talking of electric vehicles. And I said, why don't you set an ambitious target that by 2040 you're not going to use fossil fuels, particularly in the area of transportation. It's a doable trajectory. So we have to think bold. We have to set clear targets for ourselves.
1656803570.0-1656836186.0
I think there's been a dramatic increase in solar energy capacity, particularly in the last ten years. For example, when I became Minister, the price of solar power was almost Rs15 a unit. Today, solar bids are being opened in state after state where the price of electricity is about two and a half to RS3 a unit. So you look at a dramatic decline in the price that we have seen. The costs have fallen, prices have fallen, and the government has taken advantage of it.
1656836208.0-1656856446.0
And that's good. We should move ahead. But at the same time, we have to be very clear there are some areas where we will continue to have be dependent on fossil fuels. Electricity, I'm afraid, is one area. In the next 15 to 20 years we are not going to be fossil fuel free.
1656856628.0-1656904346.0
We are still going to be today about 65% of our electricity comes from coal. And with the most aggressive of solar and wind, with the most aggressive of assumptions on nuclear power, by 2040, 50% of our electricity will still come from coal. So we need that fossil capacity, fossil fuel capacity for power generation, at least for the next 15 to 20 years. But there are specific sectors and transportation, I think, is the most visible sector. And I believe that it is possible for the government of India to say that by the year 2040, no petrol vehicle, no diesel vehicle will be manufactured or sold in India.
1656904458.0-1656906910.0
This is an eminently doable proposition.
1656909430.0-1656952094.0
In your article in the Hindu earlier this week, you have written, and I quote you while the rhetoric and international forums has stressed India's environmental commitment, and while dramatic declines in costs have enabled a huge expansion in renewable energy capacity, a sense of discomfort on the current regime's actions at home will not be unjustified. In the name of ease of doing business, the regulatory edifices under systematic assault and enforcement always weak, has further slackened. When Indira Gandhi spoke at Stockholm, the public health consequences of environmental misgovernance did not occupy center stage. They do today. Could you expand on that?
1656952212.0-1656985290.0
Well, you see, over the last couple of years. What's bothered me, I've been chairman of the Parliament Standing Committee on Environment as well, environment, climate change and forest. What's bothered me is that there's been a progressive dilution of environmental laws. Forest laws, the environmental clearance process, the Environment Act of 1986, the Comprehensive Environmental Protection Act of 1986. We have the Water Pollution Control Act of 1974.
1656985440.0-1657039740.0
We have the Air Pollution Control Act of 1980, the Air Pollution Control Act of 18, we have the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, we have the Environment Protection Act of 1986, and then we have a slew of other rules and regulations related to the protected coastal areas and so on. Now, over the last seven, eight years, in order to send the signal that we are reducing regulations, increasing the ease of doing business, improving our ranking international indices of competitiveness, the casualty has been environmental forest force. There's been a progressive dilution. Institutions like the National Green Tribunal have systematically weakened. And the Environment Minister gets up in parliament and says, you know, I have cleared 3000.
1657040270.0-1657066226.0
The job of the Environment Minister is not to clear projects. The job of the Environment Minister is to protect the forests. The job of the Environment Minister is to enforce the law. And when the former Environment Minister got up and said, you know, I have cleared 3000 projects, I was forced to stand up and say, my friend, you are not to clear up. Your job is not to clear to be judged by the number of projects you have.
1657066408.0-1657098480.0
You are to be judged by the amount of area of forests you have protected, or the amount of coastal areas you have protected, or the toughness with which you have enforced environmental laws. That's what bothers me most. That dominant theology. In international forums, we all talk about India being we quote from the Vedas and we quote from the openishads, and there's always a Sanskrit shloka for every fine in the thought.
1657101170.0-1657120690.0
Nature protects those who protect it. You can quote all these things from the Atharve, from the other opponents. They are ultimately what do you do, what are you doing on the ground? How are you enforcing your laws? How are you strengthening your institutions?
1657121050.0-1657166900.0
Are you diluting your standards for air pollution from thermal? These are the issues. How are you ensuring that the environmental clearance process, of course it has to be transparent, but it cannot be diluted. If you're going to hearings, if you're going to say, as this government said, that we will give you export factor, in other words, you start your project, later on, you can get the clearance between environment and development. That's what I mean by saying that.
1657170170.0-1657203150.0
Everybody talks about international cannot be the question really is how are the laws being influenced? How are the standards being approved, how are the institutions being selected? Those are the additions. Do you think that ranked last in the 2020 environmental performance index is fair, or is that assessment biased? Well, spita on these indices.
1657204770.0-1657217170.0
I don't get too excited when we rank very high. I don't get too depressed when we get ranked very low, because there is a certain methodology for the construction of these indices.
1657219750.0-1657238780.0
I take them, I read them. For me, more important than the fact that we are ranked low on the index is the track record of what governments do. They are in power. As I said, there are simple questions. How toughly are you enforcing the law?
1657239310.0-1657260960.0
How progressive are your standards and regulations? How strong are your institutions? That's more important than some environmental index, which gets a headline here and ministry. The government will respond saying that this index is imperfectly constructed. It is not.
1657261890.0-1657271300.0
The wrong metrics have been used. I mean, this debate will take place. It's good for academics. It's good for research articles. Hello?
1657272410.0-1657297590.0
After the recent Stockholm conference can you hear me? I can hear you. Go ahead. No. The current Environment Minister, Bhupendra Yadav, he tweeted, and I quote, the developing world needs not just an industrial transition, but an industrial renaissance, a flowering of industries that will create jobs and prosperities along with a clean environment.
1657297670.0-1657312930.0
Close quote. Would you like to comment on that? Well, it's a sentiment that I cannot quarrel with. Certainly it's a fine sentiment. We need the technology.
1657313080.0-1657348186.0
We need the technological advances. And we have seen these technological advances, particularly in the field of renewables. The scene has been transformed over the last ten to 15 years. And countries I mean, for example, Germany has now become a world leader in the use of solar rooftops, something that India is beginning to emulate. And I have no doubt in my mind that in the next 20 to 25 years, the contribution of renewables to our energy basket is going to increase very substantially.
1657348378.0-1657382902.0
But there's no denying the fact, for example, energy storage, the type of technological advances that will take place in the area of energy storage will greatly improve the attractiveness of renewables. Because one of the problems with renewable energy is it's intermittent power supply. It can supply power only for, say, maybe 20% or 30% of the time at most. So storage, battery technology will become very, very crucial. So I agree.
1657382956.0-1657408800.0
I mean, these technological advances are going to play a very important role in India. Has to be in the forefront. And GDP, we traditionally look at GDP as gross domestic product. I think increasingly we should be looking at GDP as green domestic product. We should be measuring GDP as green domestic product, not necessarily as gross domestic product.
1657410290.0-1657428610.0
What was Dr. Manwoven Singh's brief to you when you became environment minister? Well, first thing he told me was on climate change. He used the phrase that I used at the beginning of our conversation. He said that, Look, I want India to be part of the solution.
1657428770.0-1657463474.0
We may not have been part of the problem, but I want India to be part of the solution. So he was very clear on climate change. Secondly, he said, we have a very extensive regulatory system. Make sure that it's transparent, make sure that it gets effectively enforced, and make sure that these regulations serve the purpose for which they were intended. And thirdly, he said, make sure that the institutions function.
1657463592.0-1657494022.0
The central pollution control board, for example, or the state pollution control boards for example, make sure that they function effectively. So it was a very simple brief. It was a 20 minutes conversation and that was his marching orders to me when I became minister in May of 2009. Now, we have a few questions from the audience, so I'll just read them out to you. Gentleman called Karthik.
1657494166.0-1657534194.0
He wants to know what has been the role of the NGT in stopping growth and development in India? Well, the NGT came about, you know, it was india is only one of three or four countries in the world which has a specialized, you know, legal framework. The National Green Tribunal. It was set up by an act of parliament in 2010. And it was meant to enable public people like Karthik to approach the National Green Tribunal with their concerns on their environment, on the environmental impact of projects.
1657534322.0-1657577410.0
People could seek damages, people could seek review of environmental decisions. It was holding the executive accountable from an environmental point of view. And I think the National Green Tribunal, frankly, in the last twelve years, in spite of efforts to weaken it, has in fact played a very positive and constructive role in city after city. People, NGOs have used it, concerned citizens have used it. People have used it in order to review projects which they believe citizens believe, not experts necessarily, but citizens believe will have adverse environmental consequences.

A steel flyover, for example, in Bangalore was stopped because of the National Green Traffic. The cleanup of the Yamuna Floodplain the ecological balance in the Yamuna Floodplain in Delhi was disturbed and that was restored because of the intervention of the National Green Tribe. Many decisions like this, the closure of the copper smelter in Tamil Nadu, of course, many of these decisions have been controversial because there are, as I said, industry would not like these decisions. But I think the National Green Tribunal has provided a vehicle for the involvement of citizens, for the involvement of people from different works of life to seek legal redress for environmental concerns. That's very important.

Environment is not a technocratic issue. It's not merely a scientific issue. It shouldn't be only a political issue. It's a people's issue. So people who are affected by chemical contamination, people who are affected by pollution, people who are affected by degradation can approach the National Green fabulous.

Telotoma wants to know, aren't countries in the temperate zone the most affected since they will face extreme weather conditions and might have to. Deal with a mini ice age. Well, we are already seeing the extreme conditions. I mean, for example, if you were to take the Indian monsoon, the amount of rainfall India gets over a 120 day period which is the Indian monsoon period june, July, August, September the total amount of rainfall has not come down very significantly. But the number of rainy days has come down and the number of dry days has gone up.
1657690784.0-1657740780.0
So we are getting the same amount of rainfall in lesser number of days. Now, that has implications for water management, it has implications for water runoff, for groundwater recharge and so on. So extreme events, extreme heat, for example, that we have witnessed particularly this year in state after state, which is having very adverse consequences on agriculture, is a manifestation of the extreme events. The floods that took place in Kerala, in parts of Karnataka, in Utrakhand were worse manifestations of this phenomenon of the increase in frequency of extreme events. So this frequency of extreme events has certainly gone up over the last decade and a half.

And the example that I gave you of the monsoon is the most striking example. We traditionally have been used to 120 days of rainfall. Today the number of high rainfall days has come down very drastically. But over 120 day period, the amount of rainfall has not declared. Elvis has a question.

He asks, with a proper roadmap, how long do you think it will take for us to see a positive change in climate? Well, I would say, you know, the next 20 years it's going to be a long haul because we have already crossed the tipping point. But we have some good success stories. The international community got together to stop the depletion of the ozone layer and that was a success story. The Montreal Protocol so countries there is some success climate a little more difficult to deal with.

The loss of biodiversity, for example. In fact, loss of biodiversity and climate are both Interlate. At the Rio Summit. At the Rio de Janeiro Summit earth Summit in 1992, there were two international conventions the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN Convention on Biodiversity. But they are interlinked, they're not separate.
1657825682.0-1657853840.0
We cannot look upon them as separate agreements. I would say it's a long haul because as I said, we have already crossed the tipping point in terms of the concentration of carbon dioxide, in terms of the concentration of methane, in terms of the concentration of nitrous oxides, which are the global greenhouse gases. We've already crossed the crucial tipping points.

If we are able to make the transition in the transportation sector to begin with, and if we are able to ensure the revolution in energy storage which will obviate the need for increasing coal based capacity in order to provide the baseload electricity which the renewables cannot as of now, that would certainly mean much. And this, I would say, is a 20 to 25 year horizon. We have to take a 20 to 25 year horizon for these investments.
1657898290.0-1657912980.0
This may appear to be futuristic, but I think decisions we take now set us on a path of meeting those targets, meeting those objectives, say, 20 years from now or 25 years from now.

We should not take a 2050 perspective because that's a meaningless perspective.
1657923030.0-1657952030.0
It's too much in the future. We must we must have a roadmap, a five year roadmap, a ten year roadmap, 15 year roadmap, and certainly a 20 year road map because you have to hold yourself accountable. I mean, if I say something for 2050, I certainly won't be around to be held accountable. But if I say something for 2025 or 2030, chances are that you can still hold me accountable for what I say today. So I think we need we need a medium term perspective.

My last question is about youth. I mean, we had Greta Thunberg.
1657961270.0-1658000000.0
Why is it that somebody, a young person like Greta Thunberg was able to draw attention in a way that world leaders were not able to? And today we see a large number of young people and youth movements around the world taking up this issue. Well, youth has the greatest stake in the future than oldies like me, certainly. But young Greta Thunberg appealed to the guilt conscience of the west. She was young, she was articulate, she was very sensible, and she was saying the right things.
1658001010.0-1658027030.0
But I was never a great fan of her friend. If you ask me. She was not in a position to take decisions. And only when you are in the seat of taking decisions, you know, the compromises that you have to do, the trade offs you have to make. So Greta Thunberg's rhetoric is great, but if you're a minister for the environment or when you're prime minister of a country, you have to make difficult choices.
1658027850.0-1658048090.0
Sometimes you make a choice which will please the environmentalists. Sometimes you will make a choice which will displease the environmentalist. But today, don't doubt about it. That the youth movement. The youth are far more concerned about, of course, in India, the youth is more worried about jobs.
1658048930.0-1658075030.0
They're more worried about livelihoods. They're more worried about day to day concerns compared, for example, to the youth in the Western countries because, you know, they come from relatively better, relatively secure economic backgrounds. And I don't blame the youth in India for putting jobs over the environment. They have to necessarily put jobs over the environment. It's the job of people like me.
1658075100.0-1658114740.0
The job of people like the prime minister is the job of parliamentarians. It's the job of legislators to find the balance that will create the jobs for fulfilling the aspirations of youth, but yet do it in a manner that protects natural resources, that protects the head, protects water, protects land, protects our forests. So I think that's the real challenge that we have to bring about this convergence between the priorities of economic growth. In a country like India, we have 10 million people getting into the labor force every year. So we have to generate 10 million jobs a year.
1658115910.0-1658136674.0
So we can't say that jobs are not the overriding priority. Employment is the overriding priority. Livelihood security is the overriding priority. Now, within that priority, how do you integrate environment and development? That's the big challenge.
1658136802.0-1658162538.0
So I have always believed that managing the environment is a one step forward, two step backward process. You cannot be a growth purist. At the same time, you cannot be an ecological purist either. So on that very realistic note, this wonderful conversation with Jarram Ramesh. Thank you so much, Jarram.

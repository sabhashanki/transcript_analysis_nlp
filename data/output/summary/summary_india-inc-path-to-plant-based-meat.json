{"summary": "Blue Trip Foods is plant based meat for India and for the Indian market. Currently we've got about eight products launched. We are present in 15 cities directly and another five or six through distributors and retailer partners. Plant based meat essentially means that you're trying to provide products which are going to taste, feel, look like meat.

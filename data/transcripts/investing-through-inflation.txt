I see a few people joining in and I'd like to make some introductions now. So today we have with us Vidya Bala, cofounder of Prime Investor. It's an investment research company and today you'll find Vidya in conversation with me about all the investment strategies that retail investors and consumers like us can adopt to protect our investment portfolios from high inflation and rates as it is happening now that we see. So without further delay, we'll jump in the question with there if you're ready. Sure.
1655170730.0-1655217042.0
Do you want to start off by telling us a bit about your journey with Prime Investors so far? Right, so like you mentioned, Prime Investor is basically a retail research platform for investors for all their personal finance needs. Prime Minister is probably among the earliest, if not the only one platform where it makes a clear distinction between selling products and providing quality research. Right. So in the Indian market, most financial advice, so to say, is typically done on a commission basis where the agents or the distributors or your bank relationship managers take commission for a product and sell them to investors.
1655217106.0-1655259966.0
And therefore by the very structure there is an inherent bias that sets them because you are literally working for the manufacturer of the product and not really for the investor. And this is where we thought we could make a big difference to retail investors who are just looking for simple solutions to put their hard earned savings. And that's where we come in. So at Prime Investor our goal is to empower investors with research and recommendations that will enable them to invest their money in platforms of their choice. And we do this by ensuring that we are structurally very independent.
1655260078.0-1655313246.0
We come under CEB as a research analyst firm and we don't take any commissions, no ads, no kickbacks, et cetera. Our only job is to ensure that we give quality research for a subscription fee to the investor. That way our priority remains the investor alone. So why this has gained importance in today's context is that when it comes to very essential products like mutual funds or insurance, you have a way to directly invest in these products and avoid the cost that goes in between that is paid to distributors and agents. And therefore our job is to ensure that people can actually buy these direct products and save as much as even 1.5% per annum, which is what the difference would be a maximum of that between anywhere between zero point 75 and 1.5% in terms of returns.
1655313358.0-1655348442.0
And on top of it, we want to show there is a cost saving. On top of it, we try to ensure that they get independent research which is not biased in any way through any kind of monetary compensation that otherwise goes into this kind of a business typically. So that's what we do at Prime Investor. We want to empower investors with quality research, make sure they get better profits at lower and also they have products at lower cost. I'm sure investors, at least at this time, would want to know more about how inflation is affecting their investment portfolio.
1655348506.0-1655389366.0
I mean, as we saw last month, was one of the highest inflation rates that in April, we saw one of the highest inflation rates in the past eight years. So can you start by telling our viewers a bit about the relationship between investment and the inflation rate? Like how a high vetion rate affects our investment portfolio or a decline in inflation rate affects that as well. So most of us, when we look at returns, we hope that the kind of returns we get from our investments will help us lead the same quality of life, if not better quality of life, right? So I'm able to, if I'm able to achieve the goals that I want to, if I'm able to buy, purchase the things that I want to, etc.
1655389398.0-1655445694.0
That with the, you know, returns that I get by saving, then basically your purpose is achieved. But that is where inflation comes as a killer. So when you start saving for your investments, thinking that if I put a sum out, I will get say, whatever, one lakh in whatever period and I'll be able to buy something that I wanted to buy, inflation can really dampen this by increasing the cost of what you are consuming. So the cost of what you consume today, when it becomes higher a year later or a few months later, it plays foils potent. And when it comes to your investments, if your investment returns, whether it's your FD or your mutual funds or your stocks, if they are unable to beat this inflation, for example, if inflation is at say, seven or 8% and your FD is currently giving five or 6%, there is this deficit cap, right?
1655445892.0-1655483654.0
This hurts people even more when they are looking at these investments as income. At least many of us earn salaries, so we get some cash flow. But there are people, retired people, who are looking at these investments for their cash flow. So when they are confronted with this price hikes, increased price of fraud, increased price of medical expenses and so on, and their investment is broad returning, what happens, the result of it is that you start taking your corpus, that is your initial investment. So you start depleting your capital sooner than you thought and that really puts you in your party.
1655483702.0-1655515366.0
So that's why we say inflation can be a killer, right? So when your investments are not able to beat inflation and there is a gap, there is a deficit, then you seriously have to rethink what other investment options you have that can help you bridge this gap. So let's talk about these investment tools now that you think is going to help us protect our portfolios from these higher inflation rates. We can start by talking about equity investments in big. Right?
1655515468.0-1655564750.0
So of all the asset classes, when I say asset classes, there is equity, there is debt, there is real estate, there is gold. Broadly speaking, there are other newer asset classes like cryptos, which I won't talk about now, but the more regulated ones that we are talking about, equity has shown time and again that it can beat inflation over the long term. And I emphasize over the long term. This is simply because as companies grow, their own earnings compound, their profits increase and you as an equity investor participate in those profits. And because equity as an asset class, you are in a way owning a piece of a company, you take the maximum risk.
1655564910.0-1655580294.0
So the risk reward ratio, if that call turns out to be successful is quite high. Imagine yourself as an entrepreneur or a businessman and your business is very successful. You reap the maximum benefits then compared with a salaried job. Right? The same applies.
1655580342.0-1655608370.0
So by taking ownership in a stock, you ensure that you are able to sustain, lead a better quality of life or get better returns over the long term. So that's where equity comes in. But equities over the short term, like we said, can be very volatile. They may or may not beat inflation. So if you ask me whether this year equity is going to beat inflation, it may not.
1655608440.0-1655654354.0
The kind of correction we have already seen in the markets this year, it may not. So the way to do it would be to use equity as a long term asset class that will deliver inflation beating returns that you can use over a period of time and ensure that any lower returns that come from your debt or your gold or whatever you hold is made up with the returns that you earned over the years in equity. So equity should be a long term part of your portfolio. And needless to say, since I say long term, the ability to take those risks come only when you are much younger. So starting with equity, then you can be very sure of beating inflation even in your 30s.
1655654392.0-1655693550.0
For example, in 40s many people have expenses for their children's higher education in their late 40s or 50s or in their 30s they start having to pay their EMI, et cetera. So starting on very early can really help them build this with equity which will help them even at higher inflationary times, it will help them compensate for the higher inflation that may be prevalent at those times. And under equity, what sort of investment would you be suggesting? Direct investment in stock market or through an equity mutual fund? Which one would be more stable in these times?
1655693700.0-1655724406.0
Right? So obviously, if you're new to the business of investing in market linked instruments, that is, instruments that don't give you any certainty in return, then mutual funds would be would make for a good beginning because it's not easy for individual investors to do sufficient research on stocks and pick the right ones. When I say researcher, I mean fundamental research. I'm not talking of short term trading, et cetera. I'm talking of long term research, understanding a company, analyzing its PNL and balance sheet and so on.
1655724508.0-1655759022.0
So that requires a lot of time and bandwidth. When you're bereft of such time, the ideal thing would be to go through mutual funds. Even with mutual funds there are about 1500 options out there so it's not easy to choose. So the way would be to have a quality kind of research support, which is exactly what I said that we do at the beginning. Or you could simply go with passive funds where you don't need to take a call on is this fund manager good, will he be able to perform consistently?
1655759086.0-1655776626.0
And so on. So passive funds, or index funds as we call them, essentially invest in indices in the market. So your returns will be as good or as bad as the market. So you will basically sail with the market. So that's another option for new investors who can't spare much time to understand even mutual funds.
1655776738.0-1655814606.0
And even within that it is good to start with some asset allocation, some amount in equity and some amount in debt. And if you like gold, a small proportion of gold and so on, so that you are diversified and you don't put all your eggs in one basket. So the goal is to invest in, say if I'm investing in a mutual fund. So the goal is to invest in a mutual fund that is giving me higher returns than the inflation is supposed to go pay over the next five years, right? So if you invest in equity as an asset class and your fund, your mutual fund is not terrible, you should expect those returns.
1655814638.0-1655850046.0
And because you can't be sure whether your mutual fund will be good or not, unless you have quality research, you can go with the market index funds, your Nifty or your Nifty 500. All of those have shown in the past that they beat inflation. But at the same time many of us cannot handle the volatility that the market shows over short term, over one year, two year and so on. It is for this purpose that we say to have an asset allocated portfolio, have some in debt, so that it act as a hedge, have someone gold. Gold can kind of hold up when the equity there is an equity meltdown.
1655850158.0-1655875930.0
So you hedge your portfolio with different asset classes. But if you are young you can have predominant exposure to equity to ensure that your capability to beat inflation is higher. Because if you add more debt, for instance, then it's the same issue. Debt is not going to return high. So you might just about be able to beat inflation or at times like last year or last two years your debt would not have helped beat inflation.
1655877310.0-1655899306.0
So therefore, diversification is a necessity. But at the same time, if you have longer term, you could go a little higher on equity to enhance your chances of beating inflation. We're just talking about gold being also a safe investment during inflation. And we see india's favorite investment has been gold over the years. So currently, what are your views on gold?
1655899338.0-1655926826.0
Because the prices are still quite high there, so it is not really that prudent for sale. First time investors like me or people in their late 20s are just starting investing to just go ahead and start investing in gold in their first run. Yeah. So oftentimes investors, because of our advice from our parents or grandparents, are prone to investing in gold first. I don't think gold, you could buy gold if you like it.
1655926848.0-1655950750.0
That's very different. But gold as an investment cannot be a primary part of your portfolio because gold hasn't shown any ability to give you returns higher than debt. In the long term, it's at roughly about the same. And gold in the last decade has become a lot more volatile than in our parents or grandparents, period. This is because globally, gold is now more invested and traded through ETFs.
1655950830.0-1655964066.0
So gold, like equity, has become very volatile. So you can't add so much to a volatile asset class. Right. So you should be using gold as a hedge to your equity. So your equity is your mainstay.
1655964098.0-1656003534.0
You put some debt and then you put some gold. So currently there are times when even gold does not perform for various other global reasons. It could be crude oil and other things, but typically in times of distress, when there is a global meltdown or there's a big negative event happening across the globe, gold has shown its ability to stay because it's like you're resorting to a safe haven kind of strategy that the world adopts. So gold still keeps that charm. So you could use it as a hedge to equity, but it's not going to deliver as much as equity.
1656003582.0-1656026166.0
So if you're looking at troubled times and going overboard with gold, that's not something that you should be doing in troubled times. There is an equity meltdown. Maybe you are actually getting a bargain in equity. So you should be looking at equity, you should over long term be holding. So instead of trying to time gold, keep it as a long term bet as part of a hedging strategy.
1656026198.0-1656038080.0
So don't try to time it or say anywhere between five to 15% maximum in gold, 10% on an average will do to kind of help you in troubled times.
1656040610.0-1656064918.0
We can take a question from Socket. Now, some of my friends from Finnworld have suggested to select a good eight to ten trips and buy one share of each every month. Is this a good strategy to start investing in equity? Okay, so in general, because many platforms have Sips in stock. Sip as a concept, started with mutual funds, right?
1656065004.0-1656082886.0
The idea of these Sips was not to get better returns. The idea is to ensure that you don't time the market. Sips, please remember, do not guarantee higher returns. There are periods when Sip returns lower than lump sum returns. So Sip is only a disciplined way of saving and investing.
1656082998.0-1656101730.0
And because you don't know when to time the market, you put it across various time frames so that you basically average. Sometimes you may be buying at higher prices, sometimes you may be buying at lower prices. Right? So this strategy works for mutual funds. But platforms have this feature of doing Sips and stocks.
1656102230.0-1656123814.0
We personally do not. We strongly dissuade investors from doing that because stocks don't. So when you have a portfolio of stocks, which is what mutual funds is, their volatility is also not too high and fund managers are anyway tweaking the portfolio and keeping it healthy. But with stock, sometimes your stock might be falling more for a reason. Right?
1656123852.0-1656149230.0
It might be a negative news that you're not aware and you think it's falling and you keep adding. Probably you put good money after a bad. So the risk that you're just averaging downwards, you think that it will go up. But probably fundamentally, something is wrong with the stock. And Sip and stocks also makes one stock go overweight on your portfolio, which is not a good thing also.
1656149380.0-1656166854.0
So instead of trying to do Sips and stocks, when it comes to stocks, yes, please filter eight to ten stocks. Wait, keep a checklist. I mean, put them on your watch list. Wait for the price points that you are comfortable with or the valuations that you're comfortable with. Enter them.
1656166972.0-1656194750.0
And in those stocks, when you see corrections, maybe in another one more phase. So maybe two or three dips in a stock maximum, you can average. But continuously buying them as Sips, that may be quite counterproductive, especially when you don't know why a particular stock is moving up or Dom. Yeah, I think Socket has his answer. Now, let's talk about another asset class that our parents also really loved is real estate.
1656195090.0-1656216438.0
And how do you see that sharing in a market with high inflation rates right now? Is it prudent to invest in real estate? Okay, consuming real estate, I mean, owning real estate to live is very different. Okay? So you're going to use it, you're going to live there, you want to, there's an emotional attachment to it.
1656216524.0-1656257410.0
So that is fine. I mean, if you can afford the EMI and you think you'll be able to comfortably repay it, it's just fine. But as an investment in the cortex, real estate is very regional. But broadly in India, the yield, as we call the rental yield, that is, if you buy real estate and you let it out, rental deal is nothing. But the annual rent that you get out of a house divided by the price at which you purchased it, the returns basically, that is very low at somewhere between 1.5 to 3.5% maximum, very high at 4%.
1656257560.0-1656280294.0
That is extremely low yield, extremely low return. I mean, compare it even with an FD, and FD gives you 56%, right? And I'm not even including the cost that you incur by way of interest on your loans, et cetera, and on the additional cost that you incur on upkeep of the property, et cetera. So most people don't understand this. They just view it as an income flow.
1656280342.0-1656326154.0
I get some rental income, which is fine, but really, unless all your loan is exhausted and the property is like 2030 years old, where you no longer pay EMI and you're probably inherited a property from your parents, in that case, the rental income is a bonus, which is fine. But in all other cases, real estate as rental income in India has not proved to be I mean, the returns have not been great. That leaves us with the gain, the growth in the property value, which post 2008 has been very, very average in the Indian context. Across cities, there have been select pockets where there has been some increase in prices, okay? Every time you go and want to buy a property from a builder, it will seem like prices have gone up.
1656326272.0-1656359234.0
But in reality, when you're selling in the India, they say seller is always the loser in real estate. So when you're trying to sell property, first of all, real estate does not give you liquidity, right? So when you're in dire need and you need the money, it takes time to sell the property. And the second thing is, it may or may not deliver returns. So people talk in terms of my house value went up by two times, three times, et cetera, but nobody looks at the length of time over which it went, right?
1656359272.0-1656393230.0
So if you compare that with equity returns, you probably I mean, again, it's very reasonable. You probably would not have beaten equity. And tax wise also, actually, equity turns out to be a far cleaner and simpler tax instrument compared with real estate, where you can incur high capital gains, and unless you reinvest it, you're going to end up paying a lot of taxes, etc. So we looked at it either way, any which way. In the Indian context, I'm not too sure that physical property as an investment, it's a great idea.
1656393300.0-1656421110.0
We do have Re eight S today in India that you can purchase re 80s predominantly invest in a group of properties which are commercial in nature. So the rental lease are slightly better in commercial properties than in residential. So when you get some decent kind of returns by way of dividend or interest from realities, I think they make for a far cleaner and simpler investment option. If one needs to look at real estate.
1656423310.0-1656434330.0
What about consumers who only have bank deposits as their investment and no other market related assets or securities? How do they deal with the high inflation rates?
1656437250.0-1656494046.0
Many FD investors have suffered in the last two years because inflation has been high, especially in the past year and the returns have been extremely low with bankruptcies or corporate FDs and so on. Like I said, the only way for them is to have built a corpus of equity. But if you're already retired and you have a smaller corpus, it's very difficult to take exposure to equity because there is a risk of losing your money. Unless you have a large corpus, getting into equity late gets difficult. So for such investors at this point currently I think options such as the RBA floating rate bonds where when rates go up currently the returns are at 7.15, very decent and when rates go up, the interest also goes up.
1656494148.0-1656546266.0
Options like those, options like the government RB has also an auction on government securities and state development loan bonds. These are bonds issued by the central government and different state governments. Those come with yields as high as 7.57.7, et cetera and they can also make for great income auction. So for those looking at income, because that's where inflation hurts the most, people who are looking at their corpus to give them income, these are some of the safe options that they can go for if they don't have the cushion of an already invested equity portfolio. But if people are still earning, they have their salaries and have at least five to seven years before they retire or longer, then these are times that they need to understand that equity and especially because the equity market is correcting.
1656546378.0-1656568402.0
These can be good times to start accumulating an equity portfolio to ensure that the next cycle of inflation at least they are comfortably closed. What about debt mutual funds? What would you say? Those would be a prudent investment. Yes, debt mutual funds, like I said, should be used as more balancer to equity.
1656568546.0-1656617638.0
And yes, by and large in a falling interest scenario debt mutual funds have delivered very well compared with FDs because your FD rates go down. But debt mutual funds make it up with what is called as capital appreciation because there is an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates. As interest rates fall, bond prices move so that delivers returns and debt returns is best captured through debt mutual funds. So to that extent, if there have been long periods of debt mutual funds beating inflation but like I said, when rates go stagnantly, which is what happened in the last two years, you have been at a low rate for too long. Even debt mutual funds as an asset class did not beat inflation right?
1656617724.0-1656647600.0
So you cannot entirely depend on them. But by and large, if you take chunks of five years debt mutual funds have comfortably beaten inflation. So you can use them again as a tool to beat inflation, but don't depend on them for those one to two year periods, unless you have a corpus built ahead, then you will be able to draw upon them during these inflationary periods. That's the best way to whether it is with debt or equity. It is about building that corpus and keeping the warships ready to meet periods such as this.
1656648370.0-1656683994.0
So for first time investors, I understand that they should be focusing more on equity and hedging it with, say, a bit of gold and debt mutual funds as they can. But the main primary investment in your portfolio, if it's equity, then that's going to help you more in high inflation time. Definitely, no doubt about it. But that also comes with your ability to take the risks in equity. So if you simply cannot handle risks and you're going to spend sleepless nights because the markets are falling like it did today, then you have to I mean, so there is always a give and take.
1656684192.0-1656712318.0
Then you have to be willing to compromise on lower returns. That comes from other debt instruments, the ones that I mentioned, like the government wants, give decent returns. There will be periods when they don't beat inflation, but by and large, they would give you decent returns. So it all depends on one's risk appetite. But if you're anger, you definitely rather than saying, looking at it as whether I want to take on this risk, the fact remains that if you're young, you have the capacity to take on the risks.
1656712494.0-1656743390.0
So even if you're afraid, you can test the markets, put smaller amounts and then slowly get used to the idea of investing in equities. One last question, following up to this. When selecting an equity mutual fund for investment, say, Lump Sump or Sip that I'm doing, what bracket of return should I be looking at? Which is, say, mid risk to low risk. So see, the returns that comes from equity is directly proportional to the growth of the economy.
1656743730.0-1656778666.0
So if an economy grows, let's say X percent, you say the GDP growth, real GDP growth is X percent. Add inflation to it and that is the minimum return that you can expect from equity. For example, if the economy is over the next, I mean the next three, four years. So if an economy is, say, growing at six or 7% real rate and the inflation in the economy is say, 5%, then expect something around 12% over a block of five years. So that's the way to look at it.
1656778688.0-1656807118.0
And this is how it has matched. If you take blocks of five years and seven years largely, and there is a small risk premium, the additional returns, you may get even higher than this, but that you should plan for it conservatively. That is why as your economy becomes more mature, like the US. For instance, if your economy is going to grow only at say, three or 4%, then you can't expect your equity to deliver 15%. And that's what is happening in India.
1656807214.0-1656847386.0
India was a faster growing economy until 2007, eight even up to 2010. But as we mature, as we become larger as an economy, the growth tends to slow. So you need to revisit your return expectations every block of, say, a decade or so. So if you are going to retire 2030 years, since you cannot assume the same return rate that you have today, and to ensure that you are not falling short of your retirement corpus, or you need to revisit and you need to save more, that's the only way. Rather than tweak your return expectation, what you need to tweak is put in higher savings to ensure as returns.
1656847418.0-1656870760.0
So even in India to a 30 30 year since the kind of return we see today may not come by because we'll be a lot more mature. Economy, then we have a question from VIRIN. You can take this with you, is. That you are a goodbye that's a stock recommendation ENT. So I will not be able to give any specific stock recommendations at this point.
1656872970.0-1656912114.0
So one last question from my side would be what should we keep in mind as we try to balance our portfolio with the information that you just gave us? What is the most important thing that we should keep in our generally list? So one is that inflation can really play spoiled sport when it comes to building your portfolio, whether it's for your children's education, your own retirement, your emergency kitty, or medical kitty, et cetera. So when you do a planning initially, it's very important that you consider the impact of inflation. It is even good if you can't do this.
1656912152.0-1656943226.0
Exercise yourself to do a one time exercise done with a financial planner. To understand the reason why you need to know this is you need to get a number on how much money you need post inflation. Most of us don't factor it. If your child is going to study abroad that it may cost 25 lakhs today, it probably will cost 45 lakhs a decade later. So the only way to do this is put these in numbers and jot them down as an exercise and also your similar thing for your retirement.
1656943338.0-1656969510.0
So once you do this, you are better placed to realize that you need products more than at least to beat this inflation. That's when you then scout for products that can help you do that. That can be equity, that can be bonds, that can be a bit of debt, mutual funds and so on. So to choose the right product, you first need to understand what is your requirement. And for that requirement, we need to factor in inflation.
1656970970.0-1657000766.0
It's prudent to have different, let's say, carries for medical costs and future costs of kids colleges, to have those taxes in. Mind while I'm planning. Correct. So compartmentalize them so that you know how inflation can impact each of these costs and then you're better placed to start saving for us. Thank you so much, Vida, for making time for us today and it was a lovely having conversation with you on this.
1657000788.0-1657022438.0

I think we can take another question from Villain if we have a minute. Almost at the end of our time, is Fmpg a good investment as a sector?

As a sector it is less cyclical. So if you want to keep it as part of a long term portfolio, yes, but FMCG also goes through its downturn. Right now, for example, the price of commodities have dented the margins of many FMCG companies because we saw huge hike in commodities as a sector, its growth prospects therefore can go up and down. But it certainly being a cash sector it is less cyclical compared with many other sectors. That's why it's called a defensive sector.

So if you want to keep that as part of a long term portfolio, you could take small exposure through mutual funds or if you are picking stocks, you could look at where the motor is higher. You don't want to buy stocks that have no distinction because in FMCG it's margin competitive. So you need to see what are the stocks that are best placed to BTC. Even companies are impacted by inflation because they are dealing with higher raw material costs, right? So unless they have ability to pass that in terms of pricing, for example, a biscuit maker cannot hike his price by too much, whereas a cosmetic company may be able to hike its price.

So in FMCG, where there is pricing power, those companies tend to do better during inflationary times, so you need to be able to filter out such concerns. Thank you so much Vidia, for addressing that question. I hope we ran that give you a clear idea of how SNCD is working as a sector and we are almost at the end of our time. Thank you so much Vidia, once again for joining us. Thanks saint.

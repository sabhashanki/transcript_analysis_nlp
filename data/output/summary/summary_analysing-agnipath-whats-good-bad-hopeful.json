{"summary": "The Ognipad scheme offers four year short term contractual engagements for soldiers with the Indian Armed Forces. It was announced by the Defense Minister last month with the service chiefs. Since the announcement, there's been a lot of mixed response to it. Dr. Trupi Singh is the chief Learning Officer at Sentiment Learning and she's a long career working within the learning and development space. She says the scheme will have a positive impact on the budget, because a lot of our budget currently goes General Huda is a former Northern Army commander from the Indian Army. He was commissioned into the Gurkha ISIL and probably one of the few really fine generals he had. So his opinion would be very valuable to us in this debate. And why we have Dr. I worry see everybody is not going to be put in the same situation. You have been to ladakh. You've seen the Cargill sector. Now here you are having soldiers in 20 men post, ten men post deployed all along the line of control. Are you going to able to actually give them any facilities or further training? There's no harm in seeing best practices that are carried out the world over. I think some of that is also peculiar to that particular country. Israel, for example, just does not have enough MANFar to be able General Hoda: We need to think from the ground level. If we can consider these four years as a graduation degree for people for the journey. I would say definitely even at our school level we need to enhance the training related to military training. At 21 years of age, what kind of jobs would be suitable for this job? See, are we saying that they cannot go into police, they can't go for any civilian work, any further education? We are asking you, we are Carter: We need to groom people and that is a grooming period. Leaving them just after four years would have impact. Some people may adjust, others may find it difficult. So there needs to be some investment into the transition. 60% of army's recruitment is going to be from people who are only 10th pass. The easiest cycle would have been if these people had been directly absorbed into central on police forces, palam RP forces, police because the skills are quite similar. The Home Ministry has announced a 10% increase in the number of ex-servicemen and women allowed to join Cuaps and other paramilitary forces. There are questions about how many ex servicemen are employed in industries like the It industry. There's also concern that a lot \"We will have to look at all these different qualifications or experiences that army is giving to the individual,\" he says. \"If you know about certain if you have certain skills, industry would welcome you any day,\" he adds. I don't think the danger of feeding into terrorism, et cetera, is going to emerge. I don't know what side could be. As a company I would have to think twice or twice to see whether I can even employ these kind of people in security jobs per se. I wouldn't sort of overplay this danger and say, look, I think these guys will go and join these sort of terrorist organizations. But largely our experience shows that people who served in the army are not really going and sort of joining some wrong organization Corporates are not getting skilled people and that's the reason the budget and everything is going beyond. So whole new industry is getting developed in the market which is on employability of people. Those kind of initiatives will also be required by these 10th class and 12th class army The mindset is changing. It will take time. There has to be a concerted effort towards it. It cannot be totally changed in two years or four years, kind of a duration. And I think that's a discussion that we The actual impact of this scheme will start showing up three to four years later when we are looking at"}

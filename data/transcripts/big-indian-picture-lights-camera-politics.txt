Welcome to Kurik. Today we are on a roundtable for our Independence Day campaign called Nyadoor and this is a show called The Beginning Picture. We will be talking about your journey in the film industry so far, what you hope to achieve in the future and your politics, among other things. So I'd like to start off with Jenny, who out your work, what you've done so far, if you can give us a brief introduction to yourself. Hi, I am JD.
1657159666.0-1657181200.0
I've been working in Tamil cinema since, I think for six years now. I've assisted director Paranjit in these six years and right now I'm writing my own film and hoping to start making it sometime this year.
1657183250.0-1657215738.0
That's lovely. Lakshmi, what about you? So I've been working not as long as Jenny has. I think it's from 2019, from the beginning of 2019, actually, but before that I had an NGO job, which was a very brief time, less than six months or so. Then once I got into the entertainment industry, then I've not done anything else.
1657215904.0-1657252598.0
So I've been working for about four years now. Four years. And I've worked in three films. Two of it was I was assisting Ashikabu and the last one, the most recent one, which is going to release soon, directed by Alpha, and then I do assist in advertisements in between. Right, through your work, from what you have done so far, one of the questions is, what have you learned on the job?
1657252684.0-1657274090.0
What did you expect to learn and what did you learn? The differences. So we'll start with Lakshmi this time. Yeah. So while I was doing my studies, I did women's studies and sociology, but my thesis was the subject of my thesis was also cinema, maria and cinema.
1657274430.0-1657287310.0
So when you're doing philosophizing, basically cinema, it seems very different. So at that point, it didn't look like I had anything more to learn, because that's the thing about philosophers.
1657290870.0-1657341490.0
Almost seems as if I got the hang of it all. But that was not until I started work, and that is an entirely different ball game, because technically it gave me a lot of insight into how the process sort of takes place. And that was very pivotal when I was first doing my short film and stuff. It was a good move that I decided to make my first short film after working in one film. And that sort of changed everything, because otherwise I had a script in hand and then I had all these grand ideas, but then later on, I just figured I wouldn't have been able to do something of that, however small it was, without having had some kind of exposure to working in the industry.
1657341910.0-1657377660.0
So, in that sense, learning about how it's more like, I think, an assistant director job, I mean, I'm sure Jenny would agree it's more like managerial kind of a job, more than creative. And all of that creative happens in your head and while you're in your room writing or on your laptop or something. But to pull it off technically and with some kind of leadership, I think that requires an experience that can only come with being on set. And that has been my experience so far.
1657381150.0-1657405160.0
So before coming to cinema, I mean, I came to cinema when I was 30. Now I'm 36. So before that, I had another lifetime of doing many other things. I was teaching for a year and I started out working with an NGO. I'm a qualified headshot, but didn't take that up.
1657406170.0-1657426220.0
I worked with an NGO that was working with industrial pollution victims. I was a legal aid with them. Then I taught for a year, and then I worked I produced a show in a Tamil news channel, a political documentary show. I worked on it for almost four years.
1657428450.0-1657474298.0
What happens when you work on nonfiction, when you work with people of the field, you get so there's just so much pride that you said the truth, and there is nothing bigger than the truth. And nonfiction is deeping and all of that. Until I came to work in fiction especially, I came to work with Ranjith right after Madras. And that was just I think what cinema has done to me personally is it made me very, very humble. Because earlier you just have you just carry all these things and then you realize that fiction is just a whole other world.
1657474464.0-1657491762.0
And that's philosophically, what it did to me. But in terms of work, I think the working with Paranjit is you get to do everything. I mean, you're allowed to write them. He will take it very seriously. You're supposed to do everything you can.
1657491816.0-1657537230.0
And I've always started from research and I have been involved in writing, and you're supposed to take some shots if the director is busy on camera one and all of that. So I just feel like it was a lot of fun to be on set. And I keep telling everyone that I am the most myself when I'm on a set, and that I'm sure you'd also agree with them, since I just accept paranoid philosophy, politically, everything in terms of craft and all of that, we just sink so well. I didn't really consider it as working on his films. I felt like I was doing it was also my story to tell kind of thing.
1657537300.0-1657563590.0
So I don't have to answer your question. That leads me to the next question as to how extensive is an ad's job, like in the outside for sale for our audiences? The job of an ad is so glamorized, right? They think about you talking to the actors and all of that, but what is the reality of the job if you can continue with that? Jenny.
1657568830.0-1657591950.0
I haven't been on a set for one year, and people see me and they're like, oh, this is how you look when you're not on set, you start from there. I see some photos from Sardata shooting spot and I'm just like, you don't even remember how you look. Let's just start from there. You're just totally, completely gone. And it is true.
1657592100.0-1657613110.0
It is true. And I wouldn't say if someone asks me, do I become an engineer or an ad, I would just say just ad director. Any point. Because every day is a new day, and in a day you're interacting with hundreds of people on set. And it's just a lot of a lot of a lot of fun.
1657613180.0-1657629290.0
There are the good sides to it also. Yes, there are actors, but I think after five days, there is after once. There is just nothing fancy about that. Everyone's an artist, everyone's a character. Every frame is a shot and everything is a setting.
1657629870.0-1657653270.0
Even when you finish the film and watch it, you're just like, you know, you're only seeing the things that you could have done better or gone wrong. Yeah, I think it's nicer to watch it from outside if you want to have a romantic view. Absolutely. At least in my experience, it is nothing but fancy. If there's anything else in the world but fancy.
1657654490.0-1657677900.0
After my first film, when I came home, my mother couldn't recognize me because I look like a piece of core. You feel dead inside. It's not even dead on the outside. You feel dead inside because you work all your odd hours. And this happens like 60 days in a row when you've been sleeping only like 5 hours.
1657678990.0-1657715210.0
5 hours seem okay when you have a normal job and when you do it for one or two days, or when you do it for about 60 days and two, three schedules when it's happening in real, it's not even funny. I have not been on a film set in also like about six months now. But that's just how shootings are. So the part where you work on the set is a very limited period. Right.
1657715360.0-1657723930.0
Assisting goes beyond the set. So can you tell us about the pre production and the post production part of your work? Lakshmikins.
1657728450.0-1657750500.0
If you were to ask me what I like better, I would prefer being on set because it's always better to run around while being sleepless than to be sitting in a place while being sleepless, because you tend to fall asleep and you're associate or your associate will basically kick your ass.
1657753590.0-1657782480.0
But then again, pre production is like a film can't happen without pre production. And if it doesn't happen with a good amount of time that goes into pre production, then it will show inevitably in your shoot, it will mess up. Because if the ads are not prepared, if the direction department is not prepared, and if they have not communicated with every other department on set, it will go wrong. Good preproduction amount of time, depending on how big this trail is is very important.
1657786210.0-1657809480.0
At least for my first film, which ran about 52 days of shoot, which was Virus, by the way, and it was huge camera. We had a good one and a half months of pre production as hectic as shoot. The film was so huge that I would still prefer shoots than pre production because that's how hectic pre production was.
1657813130.0-1657832030.0
Jenny, what do you think? Yeah, it's the same. Actually. It's the same. And when you are working on Parajit film, it's just like sometimes for Kala, for example, we were staying in Bombay and we had to go to Darabi every day.
1657832100.0-1657854014.0
And that's where we had to be. So the director was also not put up in a big hotel or anything. We just had to be walkable distance from Darawi. And we were all staying in this small apartment, all the ads, the director and all of that. And every morning we would leave at 530 to Dharavi.
1657854062.0-1657887326.0
This is pre production. This is not even pre production. This is research. And at the end of the day after, when I return to the room, which is late in the night, when I look at my phone, my phone would have read like 13 walking because there is just no other way you can like, you know, like you just have to walk. And every morning it's like she said, it's exactly like shoot schedule, you know, nothing goes when you're doing preproduction after research, then it means that you're sitting in an office and doing some work.
1657887348.0-1657918360.0
But that's the nicer part of the whole journey of filmmaking because post production is absolute madness because there's always deadline hanging right above your head. And I think all the films that I worked on except Sarpata, I worked on Kabali, Kala and Sarpata. All the other two films came with the deadline. So we knew that Rajnikan's film can only be kept under making for so long then it had to.
1657920430.0-1657968566.0
But the nicer part of now, when we are writing, I feel like this is the nicest part, but where you are sitting and writing and just preparing for your film because the moment it reaches a producer actor and your data availabilities and this and that, everything is going to change. So in that sense, now while writing, I feel like this is a good period. But while shooting, like she said, it's just any day better too, because each day you're ticking off on set, you're like one day done, two days done, three days done. You're closer to finishing the film when you're on set. So after having worked in these many films, like both of you have worked in three films so far and you're writing your own film, how much of the film that you have worked on previously or the director's ideologies influences the work that you want to do in the future?
1657968748.0-1657986240.0
Especially if we take Paranoid, for example, his caste politics and his films is very strong, and everybody speaks about it. It's known news. It's not new. So when you write your own film, does that influence your writing or do you move away to a different genre? How has that been?
1657986850.0-1658025610.0
See, I think, like I said, I came to cinema much. I feel like when I was almost very old, I had my own set of politics very clearly formed. I have a very strong deaf cleaning background, and I had definitely a sense of caste and how it works in class and all of that before coming to work. And that's also one of the reasons why I came to work with him, where my politics just got more and more sharp in working with him over a period of time. So that's just nonnegotiable.
1658027630.0-1658035120.0
It's just all the stories that come out of your brain or heart or whatever are going to be like.
1658037650.0-1658053030.0
It's going to be very politically sensitive. I'm going to try my best to not say things that would hurt the emotions of oppressed communities.
1658057050.0-1658074380.0
Okay. Lakshmi, I saw the video, the trailer for Nori Vidamatungal that was shot. I heard it was done by you, a friend of mine informed, and it's a brilliant trailer. So when you work on films like that, how much of it do you take away?
1658076430.0-1658107394.0
What is the influence of that work on your vision? Okay, I did not work in the film. The film's shooting hasn't started yet. So the director came to know of me, I think, through social media. And then he asked me to do a trailer, probably because he wanted that kind of a perspective or maybe some kind of a hooking factor, because it's clearly a trailer.
1658107442.0-1658116300.0
And it sort of did create some kind of a dialogue about the content of the teaser, basically.
1658118350.0-1658141540.0
But as far as, like, film and its politics is concerned now, for me, the politics in cinema, I think of it in two ways. One, in terms of its content, and secondly, in terms of its form, right? So for me, both of these are equally important.
1658145030.0-1658182330.0
I would identify myself as being very sensitive to issues pertaining to class, class, gender, queer, all of that. But my films may not necessarily come across as evidently talking about such things because I'm as concerned about the form of a film also. And I believe that the form of a film also speaks volumes about politics when it comes to cinema.
1658184990.0-1658226380.0
Now, I'm a huge fan of arthouse films, although I've worked only in mainstream films. So in that sense, I'm not even sure how to communicate this. But if I were to make a film, I would probably be more concerned about the form or the language of cinema more than its content. But that doesn't already told you, I studied this subject. I know the things that can go wrong in Sigma, and I can point out the things that went wrong.
1658227070.0-1658247762.0
And I think I'm sensible enough to not do such things. But even in the film that I'm writing at the moment, I don't think there's anything feminist about it. I don't see it as that kind of a film. So you don't put it back to your story. It's just a story in my head.
1658247816.0-1658288302.0
It is inadvertently feminist because you are writing it right. So that makes sense. Like you write a lot about who you are comes through your writing, so it would make sense that you are writing would inherently be feminist, or it would inherently be sensitive to certain points and subjects. So in that case, currently, with current, say, political scenario, or each of our industries in respect to malalam industry or the Tamil industry, do you really think that a new filmmaker can pitch a political film? It can be political in any terms.
1658288356.0-1658304150.0
It can be class related. Class related or the main politics, like social politics, economic politics. It can be any of those. Do you think that a new director can pitch a story like this and sell it? Actually, Jenny.
1658306090.0-1658330910.0
I'm not going to lie saying it's going to be easy to do something like that. And also when we say something is everything is political. There is nothing called being not political because it's either it's destined to do everyone quotes an elephant has its foot on a mouse's tail.
1658335090.0-1658392002.0
I think everyone puts forward any story is political, whether it is caste or not, cast or feminist or not feminist. It's all part of that. I think what I'm trying to say is that to make a film that's politically sensitive towards the oppressed communities lakshmi can speak for Malayalam film industry, but Tamil compared to the other industries in India at this point, you can say can imagine saying progressive stuff because it's not just one or two directors who are doing it. There are directors who actually directors, producers who actually believe that it needs to be said. And there are some people who don't mind getting on the politically sensitive bandwagon because it says either way.
1658392056.0-1658421114.0
I think there is a climate in Tamil cinema now where you don't have to especially with the ruling government, you don't have to worry about conceptualizing a story that would be supportive of the oppressed communities. But how many takers would there be? And there are definitely questions of there are people who ask me, is it going to be against the government? I'm like, no, it's going to be a story. If the government feels like it's against them, then it's against them.
1658421312.0-1658446820.0
There are definitely questions like this that are getting that EPS are asking, producers are asking, and that we are answering these questions. However, it's not impossible at this point, I feel. Okay. Lakshmi, what do you think? Yeah, Tamar cinema is I think it's something that everybody looks up to, especially when talking about suburban politics and all that.
1658447430.0-1658482254.0
And I think, like, she said, the climate as of now is better than it was, say, ten years back, which is great. And with OTTs and everything, there's a surge in content that talks about stories of the underprivileged. And what's also important is that it comes from there, that it doesn't come from a position of power. We probably always had stories of the underprivileged, but it always came from the not so underprivileged people. Yeah.
1658482292.0-1658506930.0
The perspective, the glance of it was not from the people that it was necessary to be a part of. Yeah. And in Malayalam, I think the trend is catching up. But I think with regards to cast, it is still something that Malayali tried to pretend. We don't have that.
1658507000.0-1658553670.0
It's a lot of pretending to do. But I think most recently, the film I can think of is Puru. I'm not sure if you've seen it, but then again, the question of where it comes from, that is an age old question, I think. Why I say Tamil cinema is something people in Kerala also look up to. And a lot of youngsters from within the Ambassador Right movement also look up to it because a lot of these filmmakers in Tamar may almost seem like it became possible for these youngsters to also become storytellers.
1658555050.0-1658583790.0
So I think in that sense, we are still very far behind. There's a lot of catching up to do in terms of when compared to Tamil cinema, is what I feel. But then again, like I said, my concern is also that we end up making films for the sake of talking about a certain politics.
1658587170.0-1658624166.0
At this point. There are a lot of these films with women as the central character and all of that. So that tells a lot here, I feel like, more than any other topic, but sometimes it seems just very force, which sort of puts me off as a film enthusiast or somebody who wants to make a file. Right. So when you say this, you mean, like, when every film that has a female lead as the lead character gets put under a certain tag.
1658624198.0-1658648340.0
Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Like, for instance, this is just my perspective. I may be completely wrong. So when you say a women oriented cinema would mean that, okay, we have to show a very strong woman character who goes against her odds and fighting patriarchy and all of that.
1658648790.0-1658658920.0
What if you want to show vulnerable women? What if you want to show an evil woman? We don't get that. That I have problem with. Right.
1658660330.0-1658676540.0
Sort of people told me my short film was anti feminist. I couldn't see it. And I'm like, how is that possible? Because it's about two women who two best friends who end up fighting with each other because one of them has a boyfriend. Yeah.
1658677230.0-1658691102.0
Which happens in real life, I think. So that is reflection of what happens in real life. So this is a question I had. It's wonderful that you brought it up. Like, how far do you think you can go?
1658691156.0-1658726460.0
Taking portraying real life stories, like, for example, your short story, it is about two friends breaking up because of a boyfriend, your boyfriend, or be it a girl with a toxic guy, but she's still in that relationship because there is a high that she gets off of it. Like, these are real life instances that you have seen around you. So what happens when you portray such stories on screen? Like, how do you contemplate that whole argument of you becoming unfeminous suddenly? What do you do for that?
1658728450.0-1658754174.0
The good thing is you can confuse everybody. So the feminists are confused and the regressive jerks are also confused. I think it's a risk that we constantly run into. See, I am writing the story that I am writing has a female lead, okay? And I was just talking to my male counterparts and I was like, how lucky you guys are.
1658754312.0-1658785450.0
You come to a roadblock and then you keep a stunt and then you just jump over that whole space and then another roadblock. I'm like one and a half. Then when I started, I was not supposed to my first film was not supposed to be this at all. But then I think, you know, the story just chooses itself for various reasons and all of that. And I start writing and I'm then I'm starting all the like, watching all the films that I watch from the lens of a male protagonist and a female protagonist.
1658785530.0-1658814698.0
And I realized that 90% of the films with male protagonists actually wouldn't be even they don't have a ground to stand on if not for the male. If two men just like if one man challenged another man and the other man is like, listen, I have better things to do and walk the other way, there is no film. It's just like it keeps going on and on. And here I'm trying to write a female potential. Oh, my God, what do I do with her?
1658814784.0-1658855254.0
And I'm not going to like I'm trying to make a very heroic female hero, but even then, I can't have her spinning in the air and fighting with 100 people, which means that I literally have to flog 20 for 20 minutes extra on my film, that people can just escape this thing. Like Lakshmi was saying, the story that I'm writing also, she makes a big blunder. And I was shocked myself when I wrote that this could go either way, whatever move she is making. And I was like, am I ready to show that? Don't I have to show her to be extremely correct?
1658855372.0-1658886942.0
Because that's what people don't take vulnerabilities very well. They think when someone's vulnerable, they are wrong. So it is a challenge that you need to but as women, I just don't think we can afford to skip that part where there are gray areas where there is vulnerabilities, where we are wrong. Because I am so wrong on a day to day basis, I'm like every third minute I'm wrong. If I can't see it on screen, then what happens?
1658887076.0-1658909320.0
What's the point of something like that? You are right. It's very challenging. But I think the difference between male filmmakers and female filmmakers should also essentially be somehow embracing this part and not letting go of it. Like, let's start maybe with 5% and then 10%, and then you talk about all of that.
1658909850.0-1658916360.0
It needs to be spoken. Otherwise you can't relate to that ago.
1658918430.0-1658938320.0
Okay, so that brings me to what your vision for your work is. Like. How do you envision your career? Do you, in your head have, say, graphs where you're like, okay, these films or these kind of films? Or how is it in your head when you think about your career for the next 15 years or 25 years?
1658942290.0-1658943600.0
Jenny won first.
1658946150.0-1658988110.0
I thought I'll borrow from you. No, I think personally, something that I have learned from Ranjit is also that he keeps quoting a baker and he says in Tamil victories, you need to have a win that cannot be ignored. And because it's not a win just for definitely a win for me. I'm happy with a lot of money and a lot of people praising me and all of that. But I'm saying politically, I think it's very important for me to make films that won't get made otherwise.
1658991410.0-1659021194.0
And also a whole range of films, the ones that my favorite, what I really want to do are surrealist films. That's like my dream. I want to make enough commercial films so that I don't have to stand in front of a producer to ask money to make surrealists films. And I am a very strong giver of commercial films, films that people would go to the theater and sit with their families and watch, because that's what I grew up watching. And I'm a big fan of it.
1659021232.0-1659035150.0
I like four songs. I like my three stuns. I like my interval blog. I love it. And I want to explore the genre, and I want to make mainstream films.
1659036050.0-1659049060.0
I want to make a film for Rajnikant at some point in my life, if he's still acting and all of that. Yeah. I just feel like I want to be everything in cinema, if that's possible.
1659053190.0-1659053940.0
Yeah.
1659056630.0-1659074380.0
I'm not so bad for this kind, though. But okay. But I think I relate to what she said about making films that cannot be ignored. So when I think of my first film the other day, I was talking to my friends also about it.
1659076750.0-1659111000.0
I have a few drafts written and I have a producer and everything that first film has to kick start. So that's the place I am in right now when I make a film. And if it comes out and when it comes out, I want people to think, okay, this person has to be looked out for that feeling. Right. And by being a woman, cinema is most definitely a very masculine space.
1659112250.0-1659125020.0
So in my head, I envisage myself going into a room with, like, 100 men and not being intimidated by them because I have this gratefulness that I've made.
1659129490.0-1659156086.0
It's a very personal and it's a very selfish kind of a dream, but you get the point. And like Jenny said, I know that. It'S not just for me. I know I have friends, like women who work in films, and I want all of them to be part of the film and like this team to be known as hair. Like all these other women were working in the film and all of that.
1659156108.0-1659157560.0
So it will be a win for everybody.
1659160170.0-1659161990.0
Like I said, it's very selfish.
1659166570.0-1659195458.0
This is a very fair ask. I don't see it as selfish because working on it with your work, you're putting out there your heart and soul and do it. So there is that. But speaking of the glance of a film, how do you perceive? There have been a lot of films that have been written well by men about women and there have been a lot of bad films written about women by women as well.
1659195624.0-1659215240.0
So what do you think is the importance of that perspective, that glance POV, as this generation calls it. What is your opinion on the perspective the female gays or the male gaze? Can I say? Yes, please.
1659218030.0-1659241710.0
I think the freedom to make films or freedom to do anything, for that matter, as women, I think is also the freedom to make mistakes. So if you make a bad film two times, that's fine. You make a better film the third time or the fourth time or the fifth time. And there are a number of men who become great directors by making a lot of bad films.
1659244530.0-1659274780.0
You can't expect, I don't know, Sophia Copolo to come out the very first time. You could easily be anybody else who's made bad films and who made their way through the industry or whatever. Even if you're making an industry fully more or an Indian film, make mistakes. I think that is an important freedom to have. Yeah.
1659276690.0-1659326570.0
There are male filmmakers and male ladies who work with me who just be like, there are a lot of women directors films that I watched and I'm like, don't make something like this in my head. But then I get these calls every time somebody makes a film that's outrageous in some form or the other and then be like, how cooked they let's talk after 150 years. You don't get to talk in the first decade or the first decade. No, let's talk after 100 years after that because you still make such bad films. So insensitive towards everyone, including men.
1659326640.0-1659335440.0
I'm saying you don't have to be sensitive towards women or people in. The whole queer community.
1659337570.0-1659370300.0
I just feel like it's a very unfair ask because I want to be able to make mistakes. Every film you watch, there are so many mistakes, and it is the generosity of the audience. It is the generosity of all the people. You've wronged for over 100 years that you are still able to take all the directors we think are pro, and today they all just turn out in this time and age and political climate, they've all turned out to be cast, distill makers. But they have ruled over the Tamil industry for so many years.
1659371150.0-1659398030.0
I'm not saying that. And hence I willingly and consciously make mistakes. No, I'm just saying that being generous with each other is very important. And as female filmmakers, I think we make sure that we are aware of the mistakes you're making or we try and not make it the next time. But that's the honest that I'm willing to take as a female filmmaker.
1659398110.0-1659402840.0
I'm not going to bear my cross if there's time for that.
1659404890.0-1659418490.0
So we have a few questions from the audience to each of you. So one of the question is to Jenny and it's about what is your favorite commercial film?
1659422110.0-1659437118.0
Is it someone I know? Can you just tell me that? It's someone called Shake and he wants to know which is your favorite commercial. Film in the recent times. Not because I worked on it.
1659437124.0-1659449300.0
I really like watching it not saying Kala or Kabbali. I'm saying farpata. Okay. Lakshmi, what about you? Which Malayalam KaMashu film have you liked in recent times?
1659449670.0-1659454370.0
Getting recent times. What blew my mind washmaw.
1659456390.0-1659467820.0
I'm a huge Mamudi fan and like Mamudi fans have been waiting for this glorious moment for about 15 years now. So DHMA varam blew my mind.
1659471150.0-1659475610.0
Yeah, that song is still in my playlist. Every day I wake up to that song. It's a vibe.
1659478830.0-1659487680.0
I've had friends who worked on it, but I didn't work on it. But yeah, like I said, sometimes it's good that you don't work in a film because you can watch the film for what it is.
1659491010.0-1659494160.0
How you messed up the costume or the art or something.
1659496390.0-1659515866.0
Mess up happens. Right. But it is not visible to the audience. Can you give us maybe one or two messages that you did that audience still don't know something that won't put. You in trouble now in OTT culture, people will go back and watch it.
1659515888.0-1659529754.0
I am not saying. Right? Yeah. Okay. So Tanya wants to know when can we see a female lead action movie?
1659529802.0-1659532830.0
Something that can make Charlie Steron proud?
1659536210.0-1659556120.0
When I don't know, when there is a good actor to carry that and when there is a climate too. Because I think stuns are own kind of stuns. I do have one story in mind, but not even going in that direction for some time now.
1659558970.0-1659598690.0
Speaking about these particular roles, if we take this particular role will suit a man or a woman or the stereotypes that exist. Like when you write your female lead film, like for example, since you're writing one guarantee, how do you ensure that you don't step into such stereotypes when you are writing, like unintentionally? Like say, for example. I'm not sure when I'm writing. I'm still not sure if I see I am not ours to using stereotypes to what end is.
1659598760.0-1659618920.0
I think the whole point in my story she's a mother. It's a stereotype when you cast. But to what end and how do you handle it? And I also strongly believe that it doesn't all I don't have to have all the answers in my head. There are a whole bunch of people that read my work at every level.
1659619290.0-1659649460.0
I also like there are a lot of friends, like, I write one draft and there are at least ten friends who read it because I don't think we can have it all sorted in our head. It's also one of the reasons why men fail terribly when they don't share their work. I don't take that responsibility at all because I think that everyone around me made me into a person, into a filmmaker, and everyone has the responsibility to ensure that I make a good film. So I am running into stereotypes. I am stepping in.
1659649910.0-1659663880.0
I'm figuring this out. I don't know how to do it and I'll try not to, but then there will also be other people who will make sure to highlight and work with me on that. What about you?
1659666890.0-1659683630.0
What was the question? Stepping into characters, female, male, even if it's a male character, like basically unintentionally, writing in a stereotype and then realizing it much later, something like that. How do you stay away from that trap?
1659689890.0-1659696050.0
I think stereotypes are fine, but I think the important thing is to handle it sensitively.
1659698870.0-1659733840.0
I could use my own like the script that I'm working on right now. She's a mother of two. There's a 50 year old woman who's a homemaker, who does cooking and cleaning for her husband. But then you sort of maneuver around the story in order to make it seem make this person and everybody around her seem the most human, who is bound to make mistakes, who is bound to go wrong, who can say the wrong things and do the wrong thing if it comes to that.
1659739490.0-1659776540.0
I think. Great Indian kitchen. I don't know, I just thought when I read the synopsis, like when I knew a film like that was going to come out, I was really worried. I was like, everything in the kitchen, how is that going to be? I just found that it was very important for me to watch because when you are also a female filmmaker and just get like so up against any normalization around your female character, court and court normalization, it's a big war in your head to draw the line and where do you draw the line?
1659776910.0-1659817978.0
I think, like Lakshmi said, it's very important to realize and show them as human as human as possible. I think that is how you handle stereotypes. I think that's a great answer. I think it also, from what I said before, a feminist film is not necessarily the one that shows a very strong woman who's fighting the odds of patriarchy and becoming the CEO of a company or the chief minister. I don't know.
1659818064.0-1659844434.0
It's not just that. It's also about women who do day to day jobs or not do jobs or homemakers or who work at home. These are all the things these are all the stories that need to come up. Yeah. So what is your hope for your industry in the next 25 years?
1659844472.0-1659859960.0
This would be my last question, and I want you to think about the thumbnail film industry and the model and film industry, and one thing that you would like to see something that's not there right now and something that you'd like to really see in the industry in the coming years.
1659863540.0-1659879300.0
Okay. One better pay. I'm not sure how it's in thumbnail, but as an assistant director, please, better pay for assistant directors.
1659885740.0-1659902620.0
That's just, like, the most pragmatic thing that came to my mind. And the other thing is more like a philosophical sort of a wanting and better representation in terms of tasks and crew and stories.
1659910260.0-1659933320.0
Both of them come under the umbrella of social justice, but one is more textual and the other is extra textual. Makes your two sense. Yeah. I think I am very saddened by theaters.
1659937660.0-1659952140.0
OTT is scaring me a bit, because I just hope that somehow we find a way to keep theaters and the culture of going to watch a film on big screen alive.
1659954180.0-1659979540.0
That's a big worry for me at this point. I know how backward and feudal and economically unviable and with corporate coming in, how it became impossible. I understand all of that. But I think somehow I think this whole culture of everything being handed over to someone sees, what if they don't give me a film?
1659983180.0-1660018244.0
But I'm saying it's just that there needs to be a balance, because I feel like that's something that I mean, not just to watch my film on big screen, but that culture of, yes, they are turning calls now, and people are talking all the time when there's a film going on. But I think going to a cinema theater to watch a film is a very important culture, I will say and all definitely. I'm not saying this because you said it and no, actually, I didn't think of it. You thought of it. It's very important.
1660018442.0-1660051916.0
But I'm just saying that probably because of the dravidian culture and what cinema meant to me as I was growing up, I would feel like not sitting at home and passing a film 100 times to watch is very important. And I think out of all the expenses that we make in our lives, ordering in Swiggy and all of that, I think going to a cinema theater should be important. I wish that we find some balance, though I know it's impossible. The lure of OTT and the possibility of OTT is too big. That's something.
1660052018.0-1660074036.0
And also better stories, like the Monopoly, that seems to exist in cinema, like, directors know when to come into cinema. They really don't know when to leave. Both is an art. You know, there's a rhythm to when you start a scene. There is a rhythm to your exit in life.
1660074138.0-1660098252.0
There is a rhythm to entry. And you should know when to be, when to come, when to be born, and when to die. There is too much retirement. Yeah. People are just taking being around for too long, I think, with more people coming in, because I know 100 stories right now in Tamil cinema that are with assistant directors that will never see the light of the page.
1660098386.0-1660115788.0
It will just not see it, and that's just not fair. People should just leave. You come, you make good films, you make good money, build a few houses, go home, and then give some space, then come back after some time. I think these are the two things that it holds good for me, too. Wow.
1660115894.0-1660135220.0
Lovely. I have had an amazing conversation today. Thank you so much for being a part of this campaign. I hope you had a good time during this conversation as well. It has been actually wonderful free flowing, and like she said, pragmatic.
1660135560.0-1660147420.0
So thank you so much for being a part of it. All the best for your future films, the one that you're writing, the one that you're making, all of it. I hope to see all your films in theaters.
1660149680.0-1660154290.0
Okay, hopefully. Thank you very much. It was nice talking to you. Both of you.
1660156660.0-1660175330.0
Thank you. And honestly, Paranjit's assistant is, like, a big title. I don't think tomorrow, even if I become a director, they'll be like, she's a director. But she was paranoid, really. I keep telling you, I don't know if you're a good thing that happened to me or a bad thing.
1660179580.0-1660197364.0
That. You write will shine. And thank you, guys. Bye.

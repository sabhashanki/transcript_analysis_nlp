First of all we will welcome our audience to the 6th episode of Pathi Patmiya picture. This is me. Priyanka. I'm Justin and we also welcome in our discussion today priyanka Chandra, who's a very popular entertainment publicist has worked on various Hindi films and also worked with a lot of artists from directors, actors, producers so she understands what goes in Hindi film industry and she's obviously also keen a Bollywood buff and she doesn't miss any film. She watches every film in theater.
1653174838.0-1653188682.0
And we always loved our discussions with Priyanka. Has she frozen? Don't ghost on us Priyanka. Why should I ghost on you when you're giving me such a lovely introduction? Thank you Priyanka.
1653188746.0-1653218370.0
Thank you so much Priyanka and Justin for having me on the show. Great. And we were just telling it in audience after two failed weeks we are finally here. So first of all apologies. Yes I think last week there was no Bollywood release hence we did not come here on Saturday and last week there was a personal emergency so we had to cancel the fifth episode last minute.
1653218530.0-1653241120.0
But here we are and hope to keep it up with it. So not wasting any other moment after we watched the film together we kind of know how we really felt. But for the audience if I start what were your first thoughts after watching which is the film that we're discussing today?
1653243890.0-1653274680.0
So my first thoughts were that I wasn't consistently excited throughout the film so somewhere I felt that my first reaction was nah, this didn't work for me. But that also comes from a space that Hulhya One was such a good experience. It was such a wholesome experience in terms of horror comic film so I was disappointed to be very honest.
1653281390.0-1653330090.0
I think I resonated with what princa said that of course it's very difficult to not think about bulbulaya One when your film has been called when your film is part of that franchisee. But even as a separate standalone film I just felt it was not funny. This is a Kartik Iron film. It has great actors like RAKPA Yadav, Sanji Mishra whose comic timing everybody swears by and of course you have The Marvelous Dabu and you also have horror comedy which is a journey growing right now in India. But you've had films like Bogo one was like a zombie comedy but still in sort of that journey and then Three, which was a fantastic film in that space.
1653330240.0-1653366600.0
So now when you have something like this you might not get the most smartest lines or script but I was expecting to laugh which the film didn't do. For me it's an unfunny film and for me to kind of forgive a pardon unfunded film is very difficult because you pay the film and you pay to watch. You want to be entertained by those books, by the comic coming but that's. Not landing disagree with both of you.
1653368650.0-1653371320.0
No. Why keeping in mind.
1653374670.0-1653389610.0
I agree with Sake here, that I found it also funny. Like, I found it silly. It was silly. Harmless, forgettable, but entertaining. That's quite a mix.
1653394130.0-1653413860.0
I was disappointed with the horror element in the film. That didn't work for me as much as it did in three. But the rest of the film, I felt like it was like silly fun. It didn't make me laugh out loud, but I wasn't also bored to death fun. And did this.
1653417350.0-1653466280.0
Yeah, see, in terms of the humor, I completely agree with Priyanka. Because, see, when it's an Anise Basmi film and whether it's a Priya Dashan film, you know that these guys are masters in comedic situations, in a comedic chaos, especially comedic cures with an expectation will be high even if you keep the horror part aside. And if you just consider comedy, for me, that was also a doubt. Because from an Ameed Bazmi film who's running welcome Singer Skiing, that comic timing, that comic interlude, for me, that was important. I mean, imagine somebody as iconic as Sanjay Mishra after one point did not work for me.
1653469930.0-1653487694.0
Sanjay Mishra for that matter. It gave me an impression that these characters have been forced to just play their part to make you laugh. Like they were only there to make you laugh at every time they were making an effort to make you laugh. That was very on your face. That did not work for me.
1653487732.0-1653491760.0
It was not effortless. It was not effortless at all.
1653493890.0-1653507230.0
Sake, you wrote you found the film funny. If you still online, can you tell us why? Why did you find it funny? Also Sadhat says it was stretched. I agree.
1653507380.0-1653521400.0
Did you feel the film was stretched watching and no, it's not like Booth Police. It's a very different concept. That was a bit of film. I had a great time watching Booth Police. In fact, both of you, if you haven't, you should watch it.
1653522730.0-1653534778.0
It's proper silly. That's the definition of silly fun. I hope Buh Bullyatu was like good police. It would have been a cracker for me to watch. Boot Police is damn fun.
1653534944.0-1653548318.0
Silly and seema. You're right that the first half is still watchable. Second half is she calls it pathetic. So I'm assuming that her experience wasn't, of course good. What about you, Priyanka?
1653548334.0-1653569510.0
What did you feel about the two halves? Which half did you like more and why? I certainly liked the second half the most because of the climax. I think the climax of Tabu. Most importantly, she managed to keep her voice breaking.
1653570970.0-1653573190.0
Can you hear me now? Taboo.
1653581690.0-1653584600.0
Is it still learning? Agree.
1653588130.0-1653590800.0
She kind of voice is perfect.
1653595810.0-1653599810.0
Same thing. I think. For me, also taboo was the saving grace.
1653602870.0-1653642666.0
Tabu was the saving grace for me. Kartikaran wasn't working. And for me again, Rajpal, Yadav and Jim ishra as we discussed, after a point, they just became themselves putting out those punches which are not landing because the situation is not demanding that kind of work, that kind of acting at that time. So it's looking very out of character then situations are absolutely not funny. I mean, it's really I think it's perhaps samji has written a couple of houseful films and also Bachchan Pandey, he's.
1653642858.0-1653654846.0
Part of Rhode Shakiri team. But damn poor writing. I mean, from an unez Basmi film, what you always expect is hard punches. Right? I mean, it will be a laugh riot.
1653655038.0-1653673320.0
And I understand that in a horror comedy you have to place humor at specific points and it can't be a laugh riot because you also have to scare the audience. But Three was a laugh ride, right? Yeah. It's such a classic example of a horror comedy done phenomenally well. True.
1653675050.0-1653692510.0
But see, even if you still can't hear me is it? No, we can. Can you hear me now? Is someone behind you? No.
1653692580.0-1653698400.0
I can see your shadow. No, I just saw no, there's no.
1653704850.0-1653710040.0
I think you're hallucinating and searching for Montreal. Yeah.
1653718090.0-1653719000.0
We can.
1653721450.0-1653733900.0
I think Three was a phenomenal example. So I was saying that Bulbulaya, the one liners, was so bad for me that I was laughing because they were so bad.
1653736830.0-1653737980.0
There was a line.
1653742290.0-1653749540.0
Your dad's a swinger. I would think this is a no brainer level.
1653755030.0-1653777110.0
That'S also level humor. And even if you see Kartikarin, I just felt he walked straight out of some set of some other film and he just walked from his previous film to this. He was just Karthikaran. Like no character.
1653779370.0-1653782230.0
Also to pitching here about Karthikaran.
1653786690.0-1653799346.0
I know that somewhere. No, but continue. You're right. I also felt it like he was on a set of some films where he was watching Ashek Mar films and then he came to Bulbulaya Two. Definitely.
1653799448.0-1653841230.0
I think his research work, his prep would have been to watch Bulbulaya One intently because it's so clear after watching, we all remember anyway, Akshi's expressions and his work in Bulbulaya One, which is fantastic. And if you see some of those expressions were by absolutely copied by a cartoon. There were two to three scenes which were designed for him to behave the way Aksha behaved in Bulbulaya One. And you just feel that no, Akshay had that. We were discussing a very effortless flamboyant about him that if I'm here, this town is mine.
1653841650.0-1653843680.0
I am the king of this place.
1653846050.0-1653863346.0
He's notorious. He's also reliable. He's a comedian in that sense that he will become notorious for you. One time he'll become goofy for the kids and then he become very serious as the film progressed. We saw in Bulbulaya, but here this guy was one tone.
1653863378.0-1653894254.0
And I guess because Kartikaran is, in my opinion, a limited actor, I mean, there's only this much that he can do. But because the film required him in every frame, that also weakened the film for me. Maybe if it had a better actor because the scope is so much if you're shouldering the film all by yourself, then you have so much scope to act, to do things, to move around. This guy just stands in a frame. He's just standing there.
1653894372.0-1653912674.0
He's not even moving. He's not using the space that has been given to him and just mouthing those dialogues. It looks robotic at a point. It looks like somebody has somebody cued him to react or act a certain way. So it's acting as pretentious.
1653912722.0-1653938442.0
I mean, that's the irony. There's nothing natural about how to kill. In fact, while watching Bourbon One, exactly what you were saying, I thought the same thing that actually in the film was the goofy guy who was also reliable. And I think he played it so well. Of course, Akshay Kumar looks like someone that you can rely on.
1653938496.0-1653955614.0
And he has a personality. And because his commentary is so good that he was also so goofy. So he was doing all those things which while you were watching Pool One constantly, there was a feeling like, can he really do it? Does he have it in him? He's too goofy.
1653955662.0-1653988734.0
He's suspecting everyone to be a ghost when he comes around. That's a great character. And of course, Piyadashar and Akshakamar, a combination which Sakit here is also written that if he don't, his comic timing is incredible. Which benefited Bhubalaya one incredibly like Akshakmar in that film, which I think no one gives him big due because it's a smallish film. But he was funny and he was so good in One that while watching Two, I just couldn't get him out of my mind.
1653988932.0-1654019960.0
There were so many scenes and punch lines where I felt Arin was trying to act like how Akshake would have done it. And that was a big downer for me. Especially the whole naughty which Priyanka said that the cook, the cunningness of that character, which I think he does not have. Karthi didn't work for me at all in that sense. It looks so fake every time.
1654022110.0-1654057490.0
Cunningness. Cunningness of Akshikumar on screen, where, you know, this guy has a lot of tricks and you can't fool him even if he looks goofy. I think that for Karthik to note. He could not emote in the dramatic scenes. He's one tone in comedy, he's trying too hard in romance, he looks stale, he looks just so stiff as compared to his costar Kiara, who just blends in the mood, blends in with the mood of the film.
1654058150.0-1654068280.0
He's your lead actor. And like you said, he just looks like he came from another set. Yeah, because that's what I've got characters to play. He's the same.
1654071210.0-1654121346.0
And also, I feel the other characters I'm saying the other characters who all the ensemble in general, all of them keeping Taboo aside. For me, it just felt like they were there because they had to be the part. Of the circus not holding their own ground not having playing a character in their own essa mujip people never it was only taboo that I felt tabu is acting taboo is portraying this character. She's portraying two characters others even though we had the Sanjay Misha we had good names, we had Milan Gunanji and all this but did not feel that he has a character. He has a different character.
1654121458.0-1654123400.0
For me they were there.
1654125770.0-1654133530.0
In the audience. Chacha was a good one. Do you agree? I think Chacha was like a lunatic.
1654141390.0-1654144080.0
Sherma truly was having someone fun.
1654149510.0-1654185274.0
In. An ensemble you can and you should have character arcs. So then every actor also brings out. Their best sometimes Priyanka, priyanka Sharma and Priyanka Chandra I also feel that small even if the character is not well written in an ensemble if the actor is great I think he can of course so memorable, right? Like despite haven't been seen so many of not a well written character or a very shoddy perhaps written character who doesn't have a lot to do in the film.
1654185402.0-1654208290.0
But the actor is so good that you are enjoying them even in bulbulaya one like Rajpal Yadav. Of course I should not be comparing. But it's not like if we know whole backstory of who Rajpal Yadav is, why is he like this? But because he's a great actor. He's having fun with the lines and body lines.
1654209030.0-1654240640.0
Rajpal yadav in both. The bulbulayas is so much about his physicality, except for the I mean, remove the head, the way he walks, the way he gets scared and falls, I think. Although it's a very physical comedy bit. Which but somewhere somewhere I felt that in bulbulaya too. He was carrying that I don't know what word to use the pressure or that baggage, but that responsibility of having that same impression on the audience, which was obviously not there.
1654242130.0-1654262920.0
I agree. One way that character really worked he was iconic, he was so funny but I think he had that same thing in his mind or that thought that I have to kind of retain that audience's love in the same way the way they loved me. I think that was there in his acting that year.
1654265610.0-1654304180.0
But like you said, Rajpal Yadav everybody I mean even San Jim Ishwa looked like he was carrying that whole burden of being funny, of delivering those punches which were actually not landing at all. I'm absolutely okay with a film being silly, a film being lame, not being logical. For me, comedy doesn't have to have logic. It has to entertain me and be so sane in its insanity. I am with you.
1654306390.0-1654332380.0
I think I was all the time throughout those two and a half hours I was just at a distance. I was just not entering the world of Bubura too. Because I felt that this is I can just pass by it. I don't have to go there to see what's happening. I'm still interested in knowing what exactly happens with the horse, with the spirit that I would give to the film that till the end, I was wanting to know.
1654334190.0-1654364802.0
But that is it. That was my only curiosity to all the film. But it's not like, oh, yeah, I wish I was there and I wish Raspal Yadav's screen time was more I wish Karthikaran was doing that. I have no such wishes because they already disappointed me in the first hour so much that for me now, it was a very possible experience. But, you know, I agree with Sake here, who had, I think, appropriately described the film for me, that it had lighthearted moments.
1654364866.0-1654384486.0
Exactly. What worked for me was that at no point did I was laughing out loud, was I like, laughing and falling on the floor or holding my tummy. Nothing of that sort ever happened. But it kept going from one light hearted, silly moment to the other. Some, of course, didn't work.
1654384608.0-1654390830.0
In fact, most didn't make me laugh, but most also kept me hooked.
1654395970.0-1654397870.0
You were laughing at the limestone.
1654403670.0-1654420678.0
On a public platform. I try to reserve judgment on my husband, but thanks so much for saying this. He was chuckling. And I remember also turning into and he's still chuckling. I'm like, the film is over.
1654420764.0-1654435210.0
Sometimes you laugh with the audience because it's a collective experience. So when the audience giggles, you all sort of contribute, right? You will giggle. Your two bits. And some lines were funny.
1654437550.0-1654458850.0
I know which time you would talk about. There's also a great line, no spoiler, but they are all searching for someone in the house. And Rajpalyada. Rajpal the most really funny, smart lines, while the search party is all and at one point he also says Hamlet. And I thought, what are they going to go with next?
1654458920.0-1654475366.0
Because we all know it's. But I don't know if someone in the audience here can sort of fill me. He does say hamlikirah, then he doesn't say anything. And I found it so funny. It's a smart line.
1654475468.0-1654492720.0
And they are also saying that they're doing that with the whole chase is all about chase is done with the song. Yeah. There are a lot of Bollywood songs also. And Rashford suddenly breaks into this popular Jew song and I thought, this is so funny. It's not that world.
1654493890.0-1654510062.0
I also like that. I think Pavan had mentioned that sometimes films are holding back because of legal and political pressure to sort of pack punches. I agree absolutely. That's definitely happening. I think that's not the case.
1654510136.0-1654531878.0
I don't think the team was holding back any comedic punches because they might I mean, maybe they did anticipate, but nothing here in this world. I mean, you can still make a better, funnier film despite sort of punching the government. In this world, if you do, it great. But punching the government was very evident. It was very evident.
1654531974.0-1654540430.0
Like Sanjay Mishra from the window out of nowhere. That was very evident.
1654544450.0-1654581786.0
I feel that, again, these lines are not kind of going with your story. They're just for effect. And it's very important, I feel, when you're writing funny films, when you're writing comedies, you stay true to the madness of that world, so that those punches are not in isolation, but they're just going with the flow. I feel a bad funny film is a bad comedy film is where I can count punches on my tips, on my fingertips. Where it happened.
1654581968.0-1654607966.0
In this case, it happened for me. Like, I can I know there were five jokes which I laughed, but I will never remember these jokes later on because they were not very naturally in the world of Mulville, too. What happens if you remember situations and then you remember lines? These were just lines thrown here and there. And because it's the the actor speaking, those lines are so marvelous.
1654608078.0-1654612242.0
Both raja. Yeah. There were Raja Sharma. Yeah. Three actors.
1654612386.0-1654632970.0
Impeccable comic. I wish Rajesh Sharma had more to do, though. Yeah. And I think I wish his character was pitched a little less of the pitch was way too high for way too loud for comfort. I said, Rajesh an actor.
1654633870.0-1654636720.0
He can deliver the best lines with straight face.
1654638930.0-1654665314.0
If his character was lower, I think it would have been more impactful and funny, of course, but it's been disappointing. I don't want to come out of a comedy film thinking, oh, there were four good jokes. I want to feel that such a funny film. Like you said, the wholesome experience of it. And thanks, Q, for tamu.
1654665442.0-1654668070.0
That's the one thing that we collected.
1654670490.0-1654686058.0
I also feel this film doesn't have any recall value. Like, after watching it, we were only discussing about bulbulaya one. That is the impact it had on us 15 years later. 15 years later, we even remember the punch lines. We remember the scenes that made us laugh.
1654686154.0-1654703318.0
We remember Akshakumar's expressions. We like certain parts of the plot. I don't think that I would remember this film. And when you watch any such film, there has to be certain recall value. And the recall value here is vulgaraya.
1654703354.0-1654719974.0
One you go back straight to. You kind of dodge the entire film, and you go back to one. So that is disappointing. I mean, a big budget film, of course, right? Yeah.
1654720092.0-1654727534.0
There has to be some takeaway. Such a big budget film. It has tabu. Kiara. Kartik.
1654727602.0-1654732730.0
Kartik works for a lot of people, but there is no recalls.
1654735790.0-1654767686.0
But I think Sadhatiya is written was not a theoretical experience. I kind of believe that I liked it more because it was a theatrical, collective experience. If I had watched it on my laptop in an OTT platform, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. So much of my Chakal and giggles, both of them are holding me onto happened because it was a community viewing scale. If I was watching the film in isolation, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.
1654767868.0-1654795040.0
And the film looks good. It's a good looking film. For me, it didn't look like I don't know, but I found it like a production wise, quite a slick looking film. I do agree with you that if this wasn't a theatrical experience, I think I would have not like the film actor. I think I would have shut it off.
1654795570.0-1654817574.0
If I'm watching on my laptop, I would have it off. But here, because you have that sound coming in, then the songs look bigger than the usual. Then you have two people, one looking stunning. Everything becomes again, that's what theater does. Everything becomes larger than life.
1654817692.0-1654847698.0
Everything becomes bigger than what it is on your TV. So a lot of times, films which you have just given a miss, Unorthod, you like them, especially comedy films, because, like Dustin rightfully said that there are people, ten people around you laughing. So you also kind of go with the flow, right? I mean, Dustin will, obviously, but we might not. But it does have an impact on you.
1654847784.0-1654875222.0
When you look around and when you hear those chuckles and those laughs, you do feel that's what you come out with, that bad film. So that's kind of a manipulation also that theater does, of course. But yeah, that it is what it is. And Pavan here has a question. Kyara meeting Karthik and going to dance festival, then to Rajasthan Bar.
1654875276.0-1654888460.0
Really, a girl trusting a boy takes a lot of effort. But it was as simple as that. I couldn't buy it, was immediately disappointed. Yeah, sure. There is definitely no logic in the film at all.
1654893890.0-1654916230.0
It required a lot of suspension of disbelief. But for me, when I walk into an anisa world, I walk in with a lot of suspension of disbelief. I'm like, okay, well, you have my permission. But the pay off should be better or should be good. I agree, though it's quite a logical leap that the film.
1654919130.0-1654949460.0
Make it entertaining, maybe I believe is the banter between Kiara and Karthik was entertaining. It was maybe very funny. And there was a give and take of the two actors that she's saying something smart and he is giving it back. You know, that there is an interesting dynamic here. I wouldn't have felt bad or wouldn't have questioned why she went along with him.
1654949990.0-1654980758.0
I'm liking these two actors together. They seem to share great chemistry. So, okay, fine, take me along. And had the festival song been much better than what it was, I think that is the payoff that I would think about. How do we used to see even today, if I have a good looking song, a song which sounds very nice, and I have had I've already listened to it before the film releases, I will look forward to it in the film.
1654980934.0-1655004002.0
And whatever takes me to that song. I'll take it. So my point is you have such a terrible song visually not good. It's audio wise absolutely bad and even the preceding scenes are not interesting. They're just picked up from like we were talking about Gay Devani, Hewani meeting I mean, cute boy meets cute girl.
1655004056.0-1655019234.0
I mean, we are done with this. Couldn't we have made it more engaging? Exactly. What do you think? I feel that the plot, the way they began that they somehow had to reach the Havaili.
1655019362.0-1655039406.0
So I just hope that I wish they had a better storyline to do that instead of being a jubby met that took her to her hometown and to sort out thing or whatever. It was somewhat similar for me. Something like that is happening in my havili or my hometown. This needs to be sorted. You come with me, be with me.
1655039508.0-1655068280.0
So it's just like somebody rightly pointed out in the audiences, right, that did not make sense. The way they met and the way they just reached the Hawaii and Hawaii that is obsolete where people are not being living since years. Suddenly you can't just enter with this case and I'm moving in here, let's just hide it. It was not easy to buy. I just wish that the story before that could have been anything else but this.
1655069610.0-1655076700.0
They just had to reach that location anyhow so they didn't put brains how to make that happen.
1655081630.0-1655092430.0
Again. Your ear is the X factor which an actor can bring if you have charming lead. Who's the guy who's actually taking her to that festival if he's charming?
1655095090.0-1655122310.0
I will go ahead with that person. I am with you on this film. I'm going to change the setting and replace the cartoon with perhaps a more competent actor. Like I was telling Justin yesterday, give this to a renewede Singh or a reveal Kapoor and they would just turn it around and make it like something extremely romantic and something really aspiring aspirational and you will just have fun with it. You feel MV Singh is having fun with it.
1655122380.0-1655138974.0
You have a great song, two actors dancing and the east to the Hawaii. Singing, dancing. I'm telling you, I would not mind if I had charm in it. But you know, I can't stop imagining raising in Burlay suddenly. Yeah, you're right.
1655139092.0-1655157810.0
I think he'd be a cool baba Raee Singh would have a lot of fun in this room. Absolutely. Bhavan is saying they could have met in that bus accident when the two of them survived and know each other and reached Rajasthan pawman, that is a good alternative.
1655160630.0-1655186330.0
Pavan, you should write more comedy or horror. One can take that liberty where you write things that you're not fictional, basically. But I feel for a prelude, when the plot is just at its foundation, you cannot show something or you should not show something that is not relatable at all. I feel it horrible. What did that festival?
1655187550.0-1655189020.0
Nothing. Nothing.
1655192930.0-1655205060.0
And just breaks out. Breaks that you are going for. Spend your storyline every day. It's at least worth it.
1655209110.0-1655211560.0
They just wanted that song. And that song was also.
1655214250.0-1655215350.0
Promoted.
1655218970.0-1655233366.0
Okay? That's why Bullyinger One was good and it was looking authentic, firstly. And it was psychological thriller. Absolutely Sadhat. Authenticity is something which preordersion brings Anise buzz.
1655233398.0-1655251010.0
Me, I've never expected authenticity from him. I have always expected slapstick comedy and great punches and cures. Like princa said, comedy and cures. And anise, does it? Anise has done it with welcome, with singular singing entry.
1655251750.0-1655273720.0
And I also feel definitely that he did not have a good actor to collaborate with, to kind of shoulder this film the way perhaps he would have wanted. And the best was taboo. And he hence rightly kept her till for the end. For the climax. Yeah.
1655274990.0-1655292560.0
I think will work in totality for two reasons. One is because it relies on the reputation of Ulva aya one and two on tabu. I feel these are the two aspects that keep the film afloat. Yeah.
1655295490.0-1655312014.0
I agree. And Manisha, just to answer your question right now, I don't think you should cancel your ticket. If you want to take my suggestion, you should still watch the film. Review. Please go watch the film.
1655312062.0-1655326822.0
Sure. But if you plan it, my recommendation would be to still watch it. It's a nice, fun, silly, forgettable experience. Humor, though. Also, mode is so subjective.
1655326966.0-1655336762.0
You know what I might find funny? You might not. Curly. Also, the audience that we were watching. The film with, they were enjoying people.
1655336816.0-1655343566.0
They were having a lot of fun. More than the three of us. Definitely more than me. These two. So didn't even like it.
1655343748.0-1655355022.0
But non cancellable tickets. Of course. Money smart. No, but watch it. My audience, the audience that we watched it in, they were having a ball.
1655355086.0-1655369110.0
And the audience included both, like, I think, teenagers to uncle, aunties. They were literally having a ball finished. Somebody was dancing. So people were enjoying the film. Somebody was dancing.
1655372010.0-1655380970.0
Has taken an opening of 14 kuros. 14.89 whatever that is. Almost 15 corrosion.
1655383070.0-1655400000.0
That's Karthi's begins. Correct. And at a time when there is a buzz and a sense that Bollywood cannot kind of succeed now, and Bollywood is over. It's finished. And south has taken over.
1655400530.0-1655420598.0
So this really looks like that Bollywood is still there. It's getting in people. In fact, I was just reading some trade critics and they were like, the film is speaking up very well. The Waterfront is good for family. So that the last song was in fact by Arjit Amijit only.
1655420764.0-1655431670.0
That's his. But let's not give any spoiler to Manish. He's going to watch his non cancellable. I know our film review has no objectives. We should not brainwash our minds.
1655431830.0-1655442654.0
This isn't a good feeling. It is a good feeling. Honestly, when I sat for the film. Yesterday and I looked around and I saw so many people in the theater. It felt good.
1655442852.0-1655482460.0
It feels good to watch a film in a bag. No other feeling can kind of top this emotion of actually watching something consumed by 100 200 people together sitting in that dark room and just there for that experience. So it's great that Hindus are getting booked. It's great that a Hindi film is doing well. It just feels sad that for me personally, I wish it would have been a better film doing the number that it will do in future.
1655483550.0-1655502420.0
So I felt it was a huge missed opportunity. And I think Rachi here said that original bulbulaya one. Correct. That's a good point. Had Malayalam and Tamil absolutely agree against the same director had made, if I'm not wrong.
1655503430.0-1655545418.0
But my point is that even Bulbulaya Two had a loss to take and Twist and Tweak from Bulbulaya One if they were franchisee. And didn't they kind of make Karthik Aran get into a get up like Akshay Kumar and they are playing Harryam Harakrishna at the same time. Where how it was done during Bulbula Year One, but copy when he was. There in that lane, then he was standing in that lane with Manjulika. And when you were recalling that Akshay Kumar has a similar scene.
1655545594.0-1655569640.0
So that was too much of an empire that I have to do this like Akshay that need to be there. No, correct. I think they could have just taken inspiration in the correct manner and took it forward rather than blatantly copying it or trying to kind of recreate that moment. I think that was not needed. That was not needed at all.
1655572090.0-1655585614.0
So we will not be taking that. Even though we have revealed some spoiler. But that would be a big spoiler. And it is, after all, a horror comedy. It has that suspense value.
1655585812.0-1655590640.0
And for everyone who's going to watch it, they should not read any.
1655597170.0-1655605586.0
There are no good movies in theater. So that's why it may have got a good opening. Hacker has got poor reviews. Even KGF and Marathon. Sure.
1655605608.0-1655623074.0
I mean, KGF has lost its name after more than a month right now. Eventually it had to stop. And it's stopping right now. But it had a great, glorious run. So in fact, Kg of Two is on a different league.
1655623202.0-1655642190.0
Marvel film, Doctor Strange, that said, as my knowledge goes, didn't quite work well in India. It couldn't sort of clock in the collections that it had to. But I agree. Even Siddharth wrote something similar that because there are average movies right now that a film like TV Two is working. Could be true.
1655642260.0-1655648930.0
Could be just so deprived of entertainment. Absolutely. Something even like a silly fun film can get in the audience.
1655651990.0-1655657090.0
Yesterday, right? That family audience is going for this film. Families.
1655660070.0-1655662660.0
And I think that's fair.
1655665210.0-1655675658.0
It is, at the end of the day, a Hollywood masala movie. It is a family entertainer. So why not? I mean, good that people families can go and watch and have a good laugh. Why not?
1655675744.0-1655683580.0
It's good. That correct. It does fall in that category. It is a family of illness. Absolutely.
1655684930.0-1655732460.0
And I think with that we can wrap it up. But before we leave, princa, how would you summarize, if you have to for us, for people who have not tuned in here but they might come on our social media and would like to know what you actually felt. So could you just summarize it in a line or to your experience of watching Bulbulaya Two? So my experience of Wool Bullaya Two, there was too much of effort for me in the film. I would also say that I have a biased review because I watched Bulbulaya One and I would only tell people that sure, go watch this film once, but don't keep Bulbulaya One in your mind.
1655732830.0-1655750434.0
Watch it like a separate film so that you can be a better judge in your own ground. Because if you don't, otherwise you will always compare it. Because I think that's what I kept doing. I kept comparing it in my head. That is also one reason it did not work for me.
1655750552.0-1655770440.0
Maybe if you don't do that, it might work for others. Personally, I guess the film had a few light moments but overall did not work for me. But having said that, I feel reviews are totally subjective. So go watch the film but without comparing it with Bulbulaya if you can.
1655772590.0-1655787022.0
That's a great advice though, but thank you so much. Priyanka. Pawan, yours just said that he has wasted his money on hiro punti runway. He's very sad. I hope you still have money, Pawan, because Lalsen TADA is coming.
1655787076.0-1655805426.0
Yes, and I think we all are very excited for that film. But hopefully Osadaas is very excited for Shamshera. But let's hope let's hope that we do have better, more engaging, entertaining films. We have Anaik Pritvira, Shamshira coming before last. Yeah.
1655805448.0-1655806770.0
We live for a Friday.
1655810230.0-1655825674.0
Next week. There will be anik next week. We will be back with Aishman Kurana star Anaik with a new guest. So thank you so much, everyone for participating in this roundtable with us and Priyanka, who's been a lovely, lovely guest. Thank you.
1655825712.0-1655840320.0
Priyanka, your insights were wonderful and I love the fact that our audience was engaging so much with us. And I hope you've answered. And we've taken all the comments and questions. So we'll see you next Saturday. Thank you.
1655841650.0-1655851630.0
The moment the session is done, check your house once. Just FII. Maybe someone's dancing. Fi believe. I'm telling you, you're missing.
1655860250.0-1655861560.0
That's what he does.
1655863770.0-1655870086.0
Thank you, guys. Thank you for having me on this show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
1655870268.0-1655870500.0
Bye.

Hello, everyone. Welcome to Kolk. Today we are starting a new show called The Culture Chronicle, where we will talk about all things music and dance and stand up comedy and food. Our first guest here today is Priya Shani Chatterjee, who is based in Galcata and who is a food and culture writer. She works independently, and she focuses on food history and food culture her.
1652483132.0-1652500780.0
So we'll be talking to her about her experience as a food writer and how she started out doing this and some of her work as well. So, welcome, Priya. Dashni, it's an absolute pleasure to have you as our first guest show. Thank you so much. Pratchy thank you for having me.
1652501550.0-1652517310.0
It's always lovely talking to you. And I'm sure today you'll have a. Team here, and I really enjoy your work. It's some of the best food writing I see around. That's something I've always felt.
1652517890.0-1652543126.0
So, prayershi to begin with. I want to start with asking you, did you always want to do this? Did you always want to become a journalist, or was it something that happened? I always wanted to write, but journalism sort of happened, and food also was, by chance, along the way, something that happened. Did you study to become a journalist, or when did you know you were.
1652543148.0-1652573054.0
Going to do that? I'll tell you what happened back in school. So in Calcutta, you have The Telegraph, and they brought out this supplement called Young Metro. And I used to send these little articles that some of them got published, and that sort of gave me this confidence boost, and I thought I had it in me. So carrying those while I was in college in the first year, so carrying some of those snippets really, those weren't even articles.
1652573182.0-1652579620.0
I went around to newspaper houses in Calcutta, and everyone said that come back after you've read.
1652582890.0-1652621890.0
But then I went to India today to sort of write for the simply called Kata magazine. And at first, they said that we usually our freelancers have a few years of experience, and you're in college, so maybe later. But a few months later, I got a call from them, and I'm eternally grateful to Swagger, since she was the editor at that point. And she called me and she said, there's this piece I want you to write for us, and it's about the five most romantic places in Calguta. I think for a first year student, that's what she could trust me with it.
1652622040.0-1652653180.0
So that was my first journalistic piece, but that's how it started. And then I wrote for simply called Qatar through college. And then I left for the UK to pursue my post graduate studies. So my bachelor's, I graduated with honors in political science, and then I went on to study media and cultural studies at Sussex. So that's my education.
1652653870.0-1652660590.0
I did not, like, study to be a journalist. Right, yeah, I can imagine you did political science.
1652664210.0-1652713230.0
Yes, but again, nothing is more political than food, is there? And come to look at it, I think that sort of that background also comes to play when I am writing about food and why I might not be writing about food politically or the politics of food. But when I am writing and how I'm writing and how I'm approaching something, I think that is always informed by all things political. Of course. And I think that's something that shows in the work that you do that it is situated in a certain politics, it's situated culturally in that space and I think nothing can take that away from food writing.
1652713650.0-1652742390.0
Yes, I think it's immensely and it's important that food is treated as something importantly political. Right, fair enough. When did you start writing food? You've told us about how you started off with journalism, but was food something that you always wanted to write about or was this? I always have had a very complicated relationship with food.
1652742540.0-1652770720.0
So I loved to eat and of course I have always been told not to with food. My relationship has been complicated because of various personal issues. I have been struggling with weight issues for the longest time, so I never thought that food could be my profession. That is something in fact, when I started writing about food, I could have all the well meaning uncles and aunts come and tell me, oh boy, you should stay away from food. Right.
1652772530.0-1652794870.0
But again, things have their own things just come together in their own way. So I happen to start writing about food again quite by chance, because some of my friends said that why not start a blog because we love what you cook. I also cook. I am aware of that. I do see a lot of posts on Instagram and I've heard the other sneeze a great cook.
1652796730.0-1652826462.0
I love to eat, so I think I can put together a decent meal. And so friends said that, why don't you start blogging? So I was working with the Telegraph at that point. I was working for their Sunday magazine and then I started blogging and honestly, just working for it was getting a little, how should I say, limiting the experience. There was a bit in terms of what I wanted to explore as a writer.
1652826606.0-1652852566.0
So I started blogging and it sort of gave me that sense of freedom. So I took the greatest risk and I quit my job at The Telegraph to sort of blog for a while and see where it took me. But after a while the blogging stopped. I went back to writing for publications, but exclusively about food and some travel and culture thrown in. But it all just sort of happened organically.
1652852678.0-1652854380.0
Nothing was planned really.
1652856430.0-1652907660.0
That's about it. When did you realize that food was going to be your forte when it came to writing? I know you do a few other subjects as well, you do write travel and you do the odd culture piece as well. But when did you realize that you arrived as a food writer and this is what should be your niche and what you should be focusing on? Initially, when I started blogging, and it was primarily a recipe blog, and at that point, I think I came into food writing from the point of gustitory pleasure, if I can say so, as in the gastronomic aspect of food.
1652911330.0-1652930866.0
But eventually that sort of changed. I'll come to that later, I think, when I was blogging. And then a lot of publications sort of approached me to write a piece for them here and there. And I realized that this is what I really enjoyed doing. This is what sort of it came from that place.
1652931048.0-1652977780.0
And then eventually I got interested in seeing food more than just in terms of flavor and taste. And that sort of, I think, made it more of something that I wanted to I think I realized that it could be something, it could be a medium, really, to help me talk about a lot of other things that interest me, like culture, history. And so that is why now I sort of try to focus on those intersectional, the intersections between food, culture, history and all of that. So initially it was, I think, the flavors and the taste and the gastronomy part of it, the aesthetics of food and all of that food review that. I think every publication at that point expected you to do.
1652978230.0-1653013600.0
Yes, there were food reviews, but when I started writing, I think some of the publications were ready. For instance, Lounge was doing some great work and then Scroll Happens, all of that, where there was space for long form exploration. So I did that. But I also did reviews and I sort of dabbled in all the genres of food writing that is there. But now, of course, I focus on long form food and culture and food and history stories, right.
1653014130.0-1653061550.0
So I also want to understand what were your early pieces like and comparing them with what you do now. And also I want to understand when you started writing the kind of pieces you write now, which was one of the first ones, and how did you start off with it? How did you realize maybe this food that I'm going to talk about today is linked to historically in a certain way? Because your piece on andabuji for instance, and your piece on leaves and flowers in Indian food culture, some of those pieces, there's a lot that you don't know when you're reading that. There's a lot you're discovering about your own food cultures.
1653062050.0-1653085480.0
And I remember one that you did around Holy on cold food. I think there was a lot that I learned about it, about why we eat certain things as coming from a Cindy family at a particular time in the year. So there's a lot you end up taking away from that. So how did that happen? If you can take an example and tell me how you go about that.
1653087130.0-1653116762.0
Again, I think I couldn't pinpoint as to, you know, that this one I can't tell you that this is when the transition happened. It was organic. But I think for one thing, the way I approach a story is from a point of curiosity and I do not approach a story from the point of authority. It doesn't matter what I know. Every story is an exploration.
1653116906.0-1653170980.0
So the more you want to know and the more you end up bringing in to your piece and the more led they are. I think that's very important for me to sort of approach. Even when I'm sort of pitching an idea, I'm thinking of an idea, I really want to know as much as I can about it. And then that curiosity has led to, again, other ideas. And I think one of the things that really interests me and I think this is somewhat more important at this point when there's a lot of exclude, how should I say this whole Castro nativism and exclusionary, should we say politics around us.
1653172950.0-1653231570.0
I wanted to tell stories that sort of talk about how fluid really boundaries are, how food of course food divides, but also how food can bring together and how I think you could use that to create more inclusive narratives. And the more you get to know I don't know you, the more you get to make sense of why and where and why you eat what you eat and where it comes from. I think that sort of helps broaden your worldview as well because you mentioned Kagina, for instance, is and I think what that story is also about is how food sort of travels and it takes all these roots and basically what we eat is we really go and look into it. It is not necessarily something that was born here 1000 years ago, but it doesn't make it any less ours.
1653236090.0-1653272802.0
I don't know if I could answer what you were saying. Probably I took a pretty unfactual that's absolutely fine. But yes, I mean, I think what your pieces generally say is that there's a version of a particular dish that we are having now and it may have come from another place. It may have evolved over time to come to us in this form today. So I think the whole journey, especially when it's talking about a singular food item journeying with it, is a very interesting way of looking at a particular food.
1653272936.0-1653275140.0
So I think that's quite interesting.
1653277430.0-1653296170.0
Over time I think you've established quite the niche for yourself. And almost most of the time when I see the title of a story, I instinctively know whether you've written it. So I think that's happened over the years. I also want you to make a. Larger comment on food writing in India at the moment.
1653296320.0-1653346150.0
Food writing, I feel, has come a long way. I'm sure it has a longer way to go, but it's come a long way from the simplistic stuff that we were seeing maybe a decade ago. There were reviews and there were interviews, but there was very little long form work and very little exploration in the category. So how do you think that has happened and what are your views on that? No, I think, of course, it is an evolution, so I'm sure it'll evolve and there'll be deeper exploration, more meaningful exploration as and more people take up food as the medium to explore whole gamut of subjects.
1653346310.0-1653388482.0
But as of now, I think the kind of food rising that you're talking about is still happening and there is a readership for all those. But of course there are people who are doing some amazing work looking at food from a whole different angle and using it as a unique lens to sort of bring conversations to the table that are super important. And I can think of a lot of people, a lot of names right now who are doing fantastic work with that. See, there's, I think, two ways of it. The one thing that is necessary in food writing.
1653388546.0-1653419886.0
When you write about food and then your commentary on food, and you go on to call some food good, bad, gorgeous, ugly, whatever, when you're writing about talking about food, I think it is extremely important to understand that your understanding of food also comes from your point of access and privilege. Right? Of course. So I think that is very important. There is a lot of food writing that happens and it's okay.
1653419908.0-1653487398.0
I'm not saying that it's not okay, but there will be that kind of writing also. But I think what can really push us forward and a lot of amazing writers are doing exactly that, to sort of not have that elitist approach to food and not keep on fueling the dominant discourses or the dominant narratives and sort of be more inclusive and bring in more narratives that have been marginalized to an extent. I think that is one thing that I've seen for a long time and that food writing has been especially around, again, like I said, that when you think of food writing in terms of a particular genre which is again dominant even today, it comes from a place of privilege and access. When you come on to say this is food and this is the food that should be eaten and is eaten, et cetera, et cetera, and you know, what is great and what is not great and all of that and this. Is how it should be done, this.
1653487404.0-1653521410.0
Is how it should be done, all of that. So I think that is something it is important to keep in mind. That how you see and it is so necessary, as in every other aspect, of life to constantly unlearn why you are writing about food? I think that is absolutely important and unlearn, not just about food, but about culture, history, et cetera, et cetera, and sort of broaden. Just keep an open mind, basically, and bring in narratives that have not got the limelight.
1653523430.0-1653536360.0
You mentioned this. I'd really like you to take names in that sense. Who are some of your favorite food writers in India? Who do you read? Where do you read it?
1653536810.0-1653558622.0
What are some of the interesting pieces that you remember? There are quite a few of them, but the one name that I'll always talk about is Sharonya Deepak. Yeah, I was expecting that name, but that's wonderful. She is absolutely wonderful. I'm a huge fan of her work.
1653558676.0-1653578340.0
I think it is absolutely amazing what she's doing and such. The kind of stories she does is not only important, it's essential. Right. Then, of course, we have others. We have Vidia Balachander, who's amazing at her work.
1653579190.0-1653594182.0
We have mehr. Burma. He's done some amazing food stories. She's also a cultural anthropologist, I believe, if I'm not wrong. So, again, that's the thing about food is not just food, right?
1653594236.0-1653611310.0
It is so many other things. Like I said at the beginning, it is not just about flavors, taste, and those nuances. It's about so much more. It's not just what you eat on your table. It's about the people who bring it to your table, people who grow it, the communities.
1653612050.0-1653631122.0
It is so many other things. And I think their work sort of focuses on that, beyond just the aesthetics of wood. Right. That makes sense. Is there a particular piece of food writing or maybe more than one, that you absolutely love?
1653631176.0-1653651420.0
Could be Indian, could be others that you sort of look up to and absolutely love going back to? I'm sorry, could you come again? Is there a piece of food writing that you absolutely love and you keep going back to? Are there names that you can name? It could be more than one as well.
1653653470.0-1653666606.0
Right away, I can think of this okay. I can think of this. One piece which I have gone back to again, is by Sharonya. It is on the tandoori, momo. Wow.
1653666788.0-1653695270.0
And how it came to be, right? And how it came to be. But it is amazing how she explores the quint sense of Del Yoba City. And she touches on so many different things and ideas of, I think, migration, and so many other things, so many aspects through something like Thanduri Momo that she calls Bakhti Valakana. But it is absolutely amazing.
1653695340.0-1653722590.0
And there will be people who will turn them with sort of scoff at something like a Tandoori Momo. But what it represents and how Sharonya captures it is absolutely beautiful. It's one story you should she wrote it for the Witters. So that is one story I absolutely love. So that's one I can think of the top of my mind.
1653722660.0-1653740680.0
And then, of course, Veda has done some great stories. Her story on Asofitida for the West Stone magazine was a stunning piece of writing. Yes, I think these are a couple of my favorite stories from recent times.
1653742970.0-1653757418.0
Which are the ones that you have done that you like most, the most memorable from your own work? I don't know. I don't know. Project every story sort of I don't know. That is very difficult.
1653757504.0-1653780690.0
Every story is special because, of course, the kind of work that goes in and you get attached. But I'm always left with the sense of dissatisfaction that probably it could be more it could be something. Yes. I am never satisfied with any piece that I write. I think that's just being a writer.
1653785450.0-1653817870.0
Every time I feel there's something more that could have gone in. But otherwise, of course, there are some pieces that I really enjoyed writing and working on. I remember you mentioned the Leaf piece. That was one of my favorite pieces to write because I learned so much from it that I recently did a piece for scroll on the Birdwan Stew, which was another fun piece to write. And I did a piece for Wet Stone on Luchi.
1653819090.0-1653843960.0
And I sort of tried to talk about the Bengali community, and we thought that the culture of the community through Lucci, and it touched upon a lot of sociocultural caste dynamics within the Bengali community of the 20th, 19th and 20th century. So that's one of the pieces that I loved working on.
1653846330.0-1653869200.0
That's quite interesting. When it comes to your own, you have been doing this for a while, and you also cook, and you have been cooking for a long time as well. What are your own food choices? Like, what do you like personally, and is it influenced by the work you do? Have your tastes changed as you work in this field?
1653870230.0-1653907226.0
I have always been a pretty, if not outright adventurous eater. I think I am pretty adventurous, but I do have my limitations, but even otherwise, have always been pretty. I have always wanted to know food from all kinds of food, really get to know flavor profiles and tastes, and then now, of course, through that food about the communities and cultures. So I have a pretty broad I don't know, there's too many things that I like, really all kinds. If I had to pick, if you're asking me what my favorite kind of.
1653907248.0-1653924278.0
Food is, kind of food and food items as well. Like, within that, if there are particular items that you like. Okay, so I'm a Calcutta person, right? I'm like a full fledged Calcutta person. So biriyani.
1653924314.0-1653931518.0
Of course. The Calcutta Biani. Yes. It has to be that with dial and all of that. So I have to talk about the Biryani.
1653931534.0-1653955420.0
It might not sound very sophisticated, the choice, but Dyani is always number one. But again, I think I love asian food. One thing. I don't like Calcutta style Chinese food anymore. That is, again, I think, and grown out of it.
1653955790.0-1653985910.0
But again, Biriyani, I love Asian food a lot. That is something as I'm growing older, I really love that. And then again, I have to say that I like a Chetanut chicken more than I like a butter chicken, although I'm married to a Punjabi, and I shouldn't probably be saying this right now in this house. But, yes, I love Southern Indian cuisines. I know that means a lot of different cuisines, but some of the flavors from down south.
1653987930.0-1654004220.0
Anything in particular, like you mentioned at Etina Chicken? Is there anything in particular? And I actually also want to follow this up with what are some of your favorite restaurants in the country and why, if I may ask?
1654007470.0-1654032180.0
Pratchy. The thing is, of course, I do have my favorite restaurant. Of course, when I'm traveling, I do not really eat at fancy restaurants. Eating on the streets out of, you know, hole in the wall eateries and all of that, that's the kind of food and I think I have had some of the most memorable meals of my life on the streets. Right.
1654033530.0-1654061760.0
But if I had to sort of choose restaurants and chefs, then it would be I quite like Manish merotrail's food. I have eaten Accent a few times, and I like the food he makes. I like Reggie Matthews, the Kcnbury. He does some great food. I'm sure there are others.
1654064130.0-1654078660.0
I really want to taste Pratik sadhu's food somehow. I've always wanted to taste his food. That is something on something I would really like. I haven't had a chance to taste his food yet.
1654081830.0-1654092760.0
Of course, like I said, chef, Manish, chef Reggie, these are, again, the first names that are coming to me right now.
1654096350.0-1654124066.0
When you say that you prefer eating in small places, I'm curious as to how do you travel when you decide to travel for leisure, is food that do you decide where you're going based on the food you're going to eat? What does your itinerary look like? Does it start off at restaurants and places to eat? Yes. I think when we sort of discuss, okay, should we check this place out?
1654124088.0-1654128260.0
And I just go on Google, and, like, the first thing, I say things to eat.
1654130630.0-1654158894.0
So that is, like, the first thing I look at. And then I start talking to people. So my last trip was to Amritzar. And I know the food of Amritsar has been spoken about a lot, but I was there for three days, and then I was getting calls from friends saying that, stop, you'll fall ill, because it was just three days. And then we have family there.
1654158932.0-1654183110.0
So a lot of meeting people, going to people's homes. And yet I think we ate at some 15 odd places in three days. Yes. So we had, like, cultures at the breakfast with cultures at least two different places every day so that I can come to a conclusion as to which is the best stuff. Like, that was crazy.
1654183180.0-1654198520.0
Mostly it is that, but sometimes nowadays we were talking about it. Maybe the next time I am traveling, I am going to just relax and just not get so worked up about what I'm going to eat before I even plan there.
1654200830.0-1654216670.0
Sometimes it becomes like I just have to try this and have to try that. And I think that fontanity is lost at times. I think that happens with me. I get so obsessed about what I'm going to eat and where and where. So all of that.
1654216740.0-1654220080.0
So I think the next time I'm traveling, I'm going to take it a little easy.
1654222710.0-1654244950.0
Also, have you had one of those? Do you remember a very spontaneous food experience that you had and that's been very memorable, an unexpected one, where you were probably not expecting something this great. Is there something that comes to mind? I'm sure there are such revelations.
1654249550.0-1654286322.0
If not that which has been one of your most memorable meals, if you could pick out one and where was it and what made it memorable that way? Okay, one meal that I'm again, like I'll just go back to your former question because I just remembered something that's fine. There is a place called Kalna, which is close to Calcutta. It's a few hours from Calcutta and it's famous for these Shiv temples. So it's really the centuries old temples and temple complex.
1654286466.0-1654318906.0
And we've gone there to sort of on one weekend with my friends and we came out, it's like 03:00 in the afternoon. We were asking people where could we get food and we wanted to eat something local. And everyone pointed out as to local Chinese restaurants and Biryani restaurants, they are there everywhere. So finally I remember we were like, we'd almost given up. And then finally we went to this shack, really Shabby, that fish and rice hotels that we have soon around Calcutta and elsewhere.
1654318938.0-1654346540.0
It's not a piece hotel. A piece hotel is different. This is a regular roadside fish and rice joint. And I remember it was called Chakraborty Hotel and Prachi. I think initially I was like, I don't know if you should eat here, but I think I've had one of the most amazing Bengali meals that we shell out so much money to eat at fancy specialty restaurants with their thalis and all of that.
1654347070.0-1654359120.0
But that food and the variety in that hotel, I cannot forget. That was one of those, like you said, those revelations that it was amazing food there.
1654361410.0-1654422986.0
As for memorable food, I think what really makes food memorable is also the settings that you are in at that time. And I always come back to this one meal, which I'll never forget. In Turkey, in Istanbul, on the bank of the Bosphorus, you have these boats that selfish, like the fresh catch of the day, and they just sort of fry it on a brittle and put it between some crusty bread and you know, you can eat that. And I remember sitting on a very cold November evening on the banks of the phosphorus and eating that fish sandwich, which had nothing but just that pan fried filet of fish between bread. And there were those bottles that you could spurt out of wine and salt kept outside these little stalls selling these sandwiches.
1654423098.0-1654445086.0
And so you just squirt that onto your sandwich, onto the fish, and you just take a bite, I think. I don't know. That is one of the most memorable meals I've had, just sitting there looking around the lights on the bus. For us on the other side, it's amazing. So that's one of my most memorable food experiences.

And I think Istanbul is the best place to eat. Okay, that's something so simplistic. I was expecting something more complicated out of this question, but that's wonderful to hear that's ultimately how basic food is. It's all about the ingredients and where. They come from and the freshman absolutely eating local, I think the place, the people and all that really adds to making food a memorable experience.
1654479112.0-1654492840.0
It's not just bunging a few fancy things together and that might make for a sophisticated dish and all of that, but might not make for a really memorable experience.

Since we have been talking about travel, you also do a lot of travel stories, I've noticed. I've seen some in a Jew and I think condonast. So is that something you really enjoy doing or is that like a byproduct of your traveling for food and your own personal travels? Prachi initially originally I wanted to be a travel writer, never a food writer, but I wanted to be a travel writer, so that did not turn out the way I would have wanted it to. Or I just sort of went into food writing organically, but then I tried to sort of because I always have that little hankering for writing about and so I try to do it when I can, when I am traveling, and then I try to get a few stories out of that.
1654555710.0-1654592840.0
It's something I really enjoy. I think that is something I enjoy as much as I enjoy writing about food, if not more. But maybe I would want to do more travel writing eventually because that is something I'd really like to do more of. Is there anything in particular you like when it comes to travel writing that is also such a huge sphere where there's so many kinds of writing happening, especially in India. I feel like it is evolving, but it's still very basic writing in terms of where to go, what to do, what to eat.
1654593290.0-1654617870.0
So what is it that you enjoy there and what is it that you want to do? See, I think best travel stories. Are people's stories, right? It's always that. And I think there is this what I had once sort of called the unbearable lightness of traveling.
1654619090.0-1654659774.0
Everything is you just know that this is not going to I don't know, it passes away in a jiffy and yet it becomes so much a part of you. I think it just alters you in such amazing ways even when you don't realize. And I think the best thing about traveling is the people that you meet in the process. And I think the best travel stories are people stories more than stories about places. And of course there's history and all of that.
1654659972.0-1654717914.0
Those make for amazing of course that's there but again, like I said, getting to know communities, getting to know people and how that sort of broadens your worldview and how you bring that to your writing and in telling your story and how respectful you are. Because I think when you're writing about cultures and places and people that are different from yours, it is a place of immense responsibility and how you approach that and the kind of respect that you need to approach that. I think in the past, a decade ago or even a couple of decades ago, even even a decade ago, it would be quite nice to say something like oh, this is exotic and this was strange and weird and et cetera. And we use those terms when writing about food, people culture that is different from ours. But I think that is changing and that should be changing.
1654717962.0-1654763360.0
All that is something that we should be careful about, that telling stories about other people which should also sort of reflect what you take away from that. And it needs to be approached with a lot of respect for everything that is different. I don't know if I'm answering your question right. I think it makes sense, what you're saying makes sense that you are ultimately sort of not just exploring spaces but communities. And there is a certain insight and there's a certain responsibility that you go with when you do that.
1654764770.0-1654802086.0
I think that brings me to that. This is something that I have been realizing myself over the last few years at least, that there's been a huge shift when it comes to food writing and restaurants and eating out as well, where there is a shift from the gourmet and the imported where what was the pattern a few years ago to local ingredients. Like when I think of it myself, my cheese comes from Ponduchari. If I have to buy capers, they come from the south of Tamil Nadu. A lot of your ingredients come from smaller towns and there's a lot of focus on local ingredients.
1654802198.0-1654846710.0
What do you have to say about that? And do you think that is seeping into the food writing that is being done in India or not? I think that is the only way forward. I think this is something that has been happening globally, the focus on local, that is I think the only way forward to keep things sustainable, it is absolutely necessary that we focus on our local resources also we support local communities, local farmers. This is again, like you said, like I was saying that it's not just about the ingredients or the taste or what we have on the plate.
1654846790.0-1654877330.0
It's so much about the life and the livelihood that is associated with that plate of food. And when you start eating local and respecting your local resources, you are also supporting your community, you're supporting people, you're supporting lives and livelihood. I think that is really the only way to go forward in so many ways for a sustainable food culture as far as restaurants are concerned.
1654882150.0-1654914990.0
And this is something that's been happening the world over where the focus is on local. And like I said again, I'm not going to repeat it, but that's more or less what I think that it is the way forward. And of course I think food writing has also supported that and also sort of also gives that an impetus. I think a lot of writers have started talking about local food cultures, about micro, regional cuisines, et cetera, et cetera. And that is also I think it's been sort of arrested.
1654918930.0-1654937030.0
I think it is absolutely important both for food writing and for the restaurant industry. Right? What according to you, is the future of food writing in India? Is it this or what is the direction? Do you see food rising in the country?
1654937100.0-1654937720.0
Go.
1654944170.0-1654986920.0
I don't know. I think there will be more exploration, more of using food to explore other, how do I put it, as a point of entry to larger conversations. At least that's what I would like to see food being used as a more meaningful because it really has that potential, right? To be used to bring more important larger conversations to the table. Because food is so intrinsically linked with everything, be it the climate, be it environment, be it sustainability, be it politics, be it anything really.
1654987450.0-1655015626.0
I think seeing food, that potential of food being used, that would be great. And I think we see a lot more of that where the focus shifts from just the gastronomical aspect. That makes sense, I think. I just have one last question for you, which I'm curious about with a lot of food writers. What are the occupational hazards of your profession?
1655015738.0-1655023300.0
Are there things that you would absolutely not eat? What happens to your own personal choices when food becomes work?
1655025590.0-1655063018.0
I don't know. There was probably a time when I would think that say somebody who is that somebody has to eat everything and has to be open to eating everything in order to sort of write about food. But I don't think that is true because you can like I said, food is something that you can use to tell your story that is the point, correct? So it's not just about what you put in your mouth and what you taste and what you eat. If you're telling stories about people, about communities, about food, that should not be something that detours you.
1655063104.0-1655099130.0
And even if you have your own food philosophy, you can always use food to tell your story, what you want to bring across, that doesn't mean that you but that has to be again, from a point of respect for everything that is different. It's not about imposing what you think on others, but you can tell your stories. You can approach food from where you are. You don't have to really start eating everything just because you want to write about food. But again, I think, like I said, I wrote about this once as a column for the New Indian Express.
1655100510.0-1655147098.0
There was a time when I would sort of be on this high horse, sort of thinking that I know foods and you've got to be adventurous and try all kinds of food and why not? And people who would not eat that food, who are not as adventurous, or people who would look for their local food while they were traveling, I scoffed at them and like, what is this? I mean, who does that? But I come to realize that, yes, for me, food is that frame that I sort of used to framework that I use to understand people and cultures. But somebody might have a completely different set of standards or paradigms to sort of parameters that they sort of use.
1655147184.0-1655183378.0
So for some people, food can be just comfort, just something that sort of calms them or a steady thing in life, and they are traveling. I think that is also important as a food writer to understand that what I think of food is not necessarily what somebody else thinks, is it? Right. So I think I have learned to deal with that, where I'm okay with somebody looking for, I don't know, Bhat Dal in Rajasthan or whatever. Not like postoalu, like the greatest stories.
1655183474.0-1655211120.0
Every travel story from my parents generation I hear is of how they found this really tiny place in the mountains or in Shimla where they were serving Alposo Dalbhan. That is their favorite travel story. So initially I used to be like, what? But now I think I'm more accepting towards that. And I think, again, that tolerance should be at the heart of writing about food.
1655212690.0-1655224340.0
But going back to that, is there something that you absolutely won't eat? Or is there a place or a space where you absolutely won't eat?
1655226550.0-1655261120.0
I don't think so. Again, like I said, I might have reservations again, but those reservations wouldn't be from the point of prejudice, but maybe from the point that I have not eaten that and I'm not sure if I want to. There might be such things like I might sort of not be open to tasting something I don't know, but it doesn't come from a point of prejudice where I can sit and tell you that this is something I would never.
1655267410.0-1655289960.0
I think you've covered a lot of it. Just one last thing, if you have anything to say. I mean, a lot of it, I feel, is heading in that direction. What would you say to somebody who wants to be a food writer, is that if there's one piece of advice you would give to a young journalist who's looking to write about food, what would you say to them?
1655292170.0-1655300220.0
Again, I'll say that approach it with curiosity, approach it with respect, and approach it with an open mind.
1655302670.0-1655362560.0
Like I said, unlearning is as important as learning is about and around food. And another thing that I would like to say is read and read about everything, not just food, because some of the best story ideas have sometimes come from books or articles that have nothing to do with food. So I think and that is how your food writing becomes more led, because then you're just using food to make another point altogether or launch a different conversation altogether. So I think reading all kinds of stuff to inform your writing, food writing is also quite crucial. Yeah, I think that forms the essence of your work, and I think, at least to me, forms the essence of all good food writing that I read that the starting point is food, but it's it almost always takes you somewhere else, and I think that's what makes it beautiful.

So thanks so much prayers. This has been enlightening and very exciting, and I'm so glad we got you here for our first guest. And please keep doing the lovely work that you do. I'm always looking forward to reading your work. Thank you so much again.

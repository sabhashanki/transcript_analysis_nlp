Hello and welcome to another edition of Open to Question. My guest this evening is Airwise Marshal Kapil Karak who combines his expertise on strategic and national security issues with his association with several Track II initiatives on the India Pakistan peace process and conflict resolution in Jammu and Kashmir. 71 during the India Pakistan War, Air Marshal Khark undertook bombing missions in both the western and eastern sectors. Following his retirement in 1996 from the Indian Air Force, he was deputy director at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi and adviser Strategic Studies at the University of Jammu. Thereafter.
1660034570.0-1660083230.0
He is also the founding additional Director of the center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi, at which he is currently a distinguished fellow. In recent years he has been a member of the high level Indian group for the Rand corporation sponsored India U. S. Track two dialogue on international security and air power issues. In 2019, Mshilkarq along with a group of other retired government servants filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the JNK Reorganization Act 2019 and the August 5 Presidential orders nullifying Article 370 that had given special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
1660084450.0-1660125770.0
He is therefore eminently suited to help us understand the implication of the abrogation of Article 370, the conversion of the state into two union territories and its impact on the people and politics of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Amashilkarq, it is three years since Article 370 was read down. You are among those who have challenged the constitutional validity of this action. Could you tell us why you feel that the continuance of Article 370 is so important to Jamo and Kashmir?
1660128510.0-1660204290.0
Well Smith, firstly thank you very much for having me over for Kulk program. Indeed feel privileged as to your question, clear as daylight that if Article 370 was not important why was it included in the Constitution of India as far back as 1949? You know how far back that means? So it basically sanctified a relationship between the then independent country called Jammu Kashmir because it's neither a part of India nor a part of Pakistan. And the leadership, popular leadership of that time, including the Maharaja who under the Indian Independence Act of 1947 was authorized to take his state, princely state or country as it began to be termed after 15 August 2 visit the Dominion of India, dominion of Pakistan.
1660204710.0-1660276378.0
Now thereafter I think the viewers are more than aware there was an attack by Pakistan. Indian forces had to be rushed in the condition put forth for rushing in the forces. But the Kashmir Kashmir State must succeed to India once that accession took place on 26 of October thereafter and that accession was for defense, foreign relations and communications only. Maharaja was completely authorized legally, morally, politically or to administer the state on all other matters other than these three which I've just named and then began the next process of formalizing this arrangement between Jammu Kashmir State and the Union of India. And viewers are aware that in 1949, when the constitution was being drafted, there were four members of the Jamal Kashmir Constituent Assembly, which was already in power at that time, who became part of the drafting committee for A.
1660276384.0-1660327610.0
Period of two and a half to three months to ensure that what had been agreed to by the people of Jammu Kashmiris and the people of India as represented by the constitution was valid and it was put in place. Now, the last part of it is therefore shekhabdula and the popular leadership and this includes the leadership of Jammu, leadership of Kashmir and leadership of Prakad. The three regions of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu Kashmir. All of them were completely happy with the arrangement of incorporation of 370 and thereafter unlike other princely states. Therefore it was not a merger of the state of Jammu Kashmir with the Indian Union, but an integration.
1660328190.0-1660368294.0
And so I think everyone was happy. It is only that's what I'm saying the importance lies in the fact that 370 represents the sense of identity, sense of individual purpose, the sense of belonging to a state as reflected in the deep psyche of the people of Jamon Kashmir. I'm often asked by my friends when we go there and this happened from 1950s all known words that an average boatman or a taxi driver says up India, say I am. So there is a lot of resentment. What do you mean?
1660368412.0-1660377846.0
But that's how it was for centuries. Have you come from India? Have you come from Afghanistan? Have you come from Sri Lanka? That was attitude.
1660377878.0-1660404050.0
So that habit has continued with the people. So the short point is identity, identity, identity. And that's what was shattered by the actions of 5 August 2019 which continues a kind of psychological and emotional breakdown of the political psyche of the people of JNK, particularly the Valley.
1660406150.0-1660426140.0
What you're saying is that article 370 also gave Jammu and Kashmir a high level of functional autonomy. But as we know, over these last years, since 1949 this autonomy has got a practice eroded a great deal.
1660429870.0-1660460974.0
Why were people so upset about the nullification? I mean, in actual terms, what did the people of the state lose through the abrogation you have already talked about? They've lost their sense of identity. But beyond that, what else have they lost? I think first and foremost, I must say this is a very deep and pointed question because the title is Troubled History of Jamal Kashmir.
1660461022.0-1660513606.0
So unless we look at the troubled part carefully we'll not come to the right conclusions here. Let me say the beginning of the problem of dilution, of the autonomy or efforts towards the direction, began as early as 1950 in Jammu, where the then praja parishad, which was known as the king's party this was maharaja. Ari Singh's kind of indirectly. His party, which has spearheaded a movement for cancellation or dilution of the autonomy jamon kashmir's full integration with India. And there being no question of an independent flag for that matter not independent, I wouldn't say that.
1660513628.0-1660559358.0
But a state flag and a constitution for it. And the sloganeering I've seen myself as a child, I live very close to the Chip chip minister's residence was that nahida. And that moment of 1950 is what came out full circle on 5 August. Because the precursor, the successor, political successor to the Pragya Parishad was the Hindu Mahasabha followed by the Jansen. After that, the barakaya.
1660559374.0-1660605842.0
Jansen There were various of tasks but the essential critical component of the ideological underpinning of that construct by political party was that Jamal Kashmir should be like Biharis to India or other Pradeshis to India or Rajasthanist to India. Well, that was not the arrangement. I'm sorry to take you back and forth but it's important. I want people to understand because a lot of people don't understand the finer points. When Sheikh Abdullah went to and this is on record, it's all books I can quote agent Urani's article 371 more by Mr.
1660605896.0-1660635946.0
Anand, justice Anand book titled 370. So they quoted Faruk Sheikh Abdullah went to Saddat Patel and Sadhg Patel said you please take your state to Pakistan as far as I'm concerned. These are Saddat Patel's words. There's a quote I'm saying, quote unquote and you take your state to Pakistan as far as I'm concerned. I'm preoccupied with Hyderabad because Hyderabad was the other trouble spoke.
1660636058.0-1660654286.0
Junkad was another trouble spoke hyderabad population was predominantly Hindu. The ruler was disarmed Muslim. Junakad was population was predominantly Hindu. The ruler was a divan who was a Muslim. Then you came to Jamal Kashmir.
1660654478.0-1660688842.0
The population was Muslim, predominantly Muslim, something like 68 70% and the rest 30% were Hindu. I'm talking about the entire state. Very small component of Buddhist. But here was the exception having faith in the secular, democratic, inclusive concept of India as enunciated by the leadership of the time led by of course Nehru and Sadhar Patel. Not to forget Mahgawi sheikh Abdulrah said no, I'll not go to Pakistan.
1660688906.0-1660718550.0
He's a popular leader, I'll go to India but I have a special identity. And that's what defines article 317. He put his virtually the stake on that article being the defining characteristic. It was later defined by Bulzarila Nanda, once upon a time acting Prime Minister of India. That Article 370 is neither a wall nor a mountain, but it's a tunnel.
1660719070.0-1660760786.0
That tunnel links India with the state of Jamaica. So this is this is you talked about another critical moment. Delhi agreement signed in 1952 again formalizing the concept of constitution of a constituent assembly which will define in myriad ways as to how the linkage will develop. These are matters of detail in the Delhi agreement. And it may be interesting for your viewers to know that Delhi agreement was passed by two thirds majority in the Lok Sabha in New Delhi.
1660760978.0-1660792270.0
It was passed by a majority of the Jamal Kashmir Constituent Assembly. So you see, there is unanimity the devil in the detail has been the combination of what we see today, the muscular militaristic nationalism combined with political Hindus. Now, that's what was the defining moment of the referred to the Praja Kavisha and its agitation.
1660795570.0-1660856670.0
Now, most Kashmiri pundits, that is the popular view, are happy with the actions of this government. But even though you are a Kashmiri pundit who lost his home in the Kashmir Valley, as you just told us, you see things differently. Why? Or are we wrong when we think that most Kashmiri pundits are happy with the reading down of Article 370? No, I think this is a very delicate and sensitive point for all of us Kashmiri pundits because the pain and suffering that one goes through when one loses the linkages with millennialong geocultural mosaic, linkages with your holy springs, your temples, your seasons these are historical in so many ways and sort of tears asunder you from your past.
1660856840.0-1660945194.0
And that is a pain I do deeply feel as a Kashmiri pundit. But at the same time, I feel I'm responsible enough as a citizen of the Jammu Kashmir state and of course, citizen of India that one has to rise beyond one's immediate pain. To look at the larger quote, the Kashmiri pundits, when they left the valley, nearly 300,000 of them, almost the entire lot, 200,000 in Jammu, about 100,000 in the national capital region, and the rest, about 20 to 50,000 in the rest of India. Now, they were helped by some of the, you know, majoritarian oriented parties which were in power in the in the way some of the states and they were given admission in schools and colleges and professional colleges for children of Kashmiri pundits which in a sense served as an inducement to them to embrace the majority enforces. There was also an element, they felt that the majority in their own community, in their own state did not do enough to ensure that they did not get migrated or didn't be part of the exile that they went through.
1660945332.0-1660983854.0
But I think here we need to differentiate various impulses. The differentiation is that it was a horrible moment in the history of Jamal Kashmir. There was no order, there was no state. The governor's written run and administration had collapsed in that moment, even the majority, there were about approximately 600 out Kashmiri pundits who were targeted in terms of killings. But there was nearly 25 times, 30 times, perhaps even 50 times more than that immediately that time who were also members of the majority community.
1660984052.0-1661036842.0
So it's not that many people got killed. That's first point. Second point is, and I think here is a great deal of disappointment, that even the current dispensation, which has been in power for eight years, has done absolutely nothing for the Kashmiri pundits. And yet when they came into power, if you remember, in 2014, it seemed that the only agenda this coming in new government had was Kashmiri pundits, nothing else. So you see that I talked to me, the only good thing that has been done for the Kashmiri pundits is by Prime Minister Man Moon, who evolved in a very strategic manner a policy of ensuring employment to about 6000 people in Kashmir valley.
1661036906.0-1661063474.0
Condition was they have to stay in the valley and they were employed and that 6000 is completed. Now, that policy was evolved in 2010. So you can imagine how hopelessly slow the government has been even over the last eight years. They won't even kill those 6000 posts in eight years. These are government jobs, or they were government jobs.
1661063522.0-1661126650.0
And there are also private jobs which the Kashmiri pundits who the rest of the India have gone back and taken up those jobs. There's also an arrangement, as you are aware and viewers are conscious of that fact, that the plan was to also build for them certain transit accommodations which are gated and secure because there is still a conflict zone there. And out of those, once again, I'm not being critical of a particular party. Kashmir has been a mess created by successive governments and successive parties. I will take you back for your viewers, back for just a minute and a half to say that from 1950s onwards, and this is the Congress government under Nehru Javad, that they first use corruption as an adhesive to bond the Kashmiri society vertically and horizontally.
1661127150.0-1661205038.0
Then the second point they did was in terms of denial of something as basic as voting to people, because all the election completely and totally sort of fabricated and they were not true and impartial and fair. Thirdly, and more importantly, democracy was choked because if you wanted, you also wanted a puppetize leadership, so you created puppets which ran jamon Kashmir. So puppetization rigging of elections. 10th question of denial of democracy have successively led to the last straw on the Campbell back in 1987 when widespread election took place, because Farooq Abdullah at that time perhaps the center felt, may not win the election. And the Muslim United Front, which is the people like Yassin Malik and other leaders who are election agents, they did not get elected where they had won the books.
1661205134.0-1661247202.0
The point I'm trying to make is now when we look at policies on Kashmiri pundits, they have recently been targeted. Of course, only two Kashmiri pundits have died, but minorities have been targeted because of the fifth August 2009 shattering blow to the Kashmiri majority community of the valley. Earlier they would come in the streets, earlier there would be militants here with guns replaced later by stones. The conversation was between the security force rifle and the stone or the gun of the militant. Now that was the defining feature of Kashmir for so many years.
1661247256.0-1661284046.0
You're such a senior experienced journalist yourself. These are not relations to you. But the unfortunate path is that no government until now has ever failed with 370 including Bajpai, who was the leader of the BJP, who was the Prime Minister of India for five full years. He never did. In fact, he went forward and talked about the resolution through the system of Jamudya, Insania and Kashmir as he described it.
1661284148.0-1661328406.0
And you are aware the period 2003 to 2004 was a golden period for not only center GNK relations but also the relations between India and Pakistan. Because we must not forget Pakistan also is a factor. Although Pakistan has somewhat reduced the tap of terrorism because it's so fatally weakened, it has so many inherent contradictions its economy is virtually in a downward spiral. There is so much political incoherence and instability. All these factors factors put together make although Pakistan is a stakeholder.
1661328518.0-1661350930.0
But even Kashmiris today from the majority community do not see Pakistan as being of any help to them which they saw earlier as a counter to any hegemonistic majoritarian forces which may prevail over them, which is very natural for a community which is a minority in the rest of India.
1661353430.0-1661372140.0
Along with the abrogation of 370, the other thing that the government did was to split the state into two union territories. This had a huge impact also in the states. Could you tell us why and how you see that?
1661374270.0-1661425690.0
This is a delicious irony that politics shows up because when the article was read down, to use your expression on 5 August there were celebrations in Jammu which included all most of the Jammuites and the 200,000 Kashmiris would virtually more than half of the Kashmiris would left the valley. They do celebrate it. But as I said earlier, the devil is in the detail. They soon realized that the demographic change if it was negatively impacted any region, it was Jammu. Secondly, Jammu was open to industrialists and investors from the rest of India.
1661426590.0-1661466198.0
Then they began to raise the noise and a cry for their land, for their jobs, for a domicile status. And that's what Article 370 was about. An article 35 way. What was what was Article 35? A 1927 Maharaja Hari Singh made a special provision at the request of the Kashmiri pundits and the dogras of that time that jobs, land and opportunities in education including scholarships, etc will be reserved only for the permanent residents of the JNK state.
1661466364.0-1661484782.0
There were conditions. I think anyone who was resident shaman Krishna in 1944 became a resident thereafter. Those before that were already residents. So there was no question. So why am I making this point exactly the same thing?
1661484836.0-1661544670.0
When I went to Jammu just two and a half months ago and we met the cross section of Jammu society, civil society, intellectuals, academia, businessmen, lawyers, all communities said that we actually initiated an agitation. They initiated an agitation for not reserving jobs and land management, including the Domicile status for them and leaving them open to be in many ways be assaulted upon by people from outside. Incidentally, as you are aware, Smith, I don't have to remind you there is something called an Article 371, absolutely seven states doing exactly what I just said. So the point I'm trying to make about Ladakh, you asked about Jammu, I'll take you to Ladakh. Similar celebration.
1661545410.0-1661577414.0
I said now we have been demanding union territory. We are now not under the pressure of the Jammuites or the Kashmiris. And they were given us self governance, but there was no provision for their reserving the rights to land and jobs and missile status. So you could have and radar, as you know, is a tourist paradise. And there are no number of people who began to invest in hotels and radakis felt that their rights were being snatched.
1661577542.0-1661633834.0
And in the case of Cardgill, they were totally against it because, you know, the lawyer viewers know that Cargill district, Ladakh has two district. Cardgirl district is majority Muslim, is very marginally majority Buddhist. In fact, next senses, take my word for it, the entire Ladakh region will be Muslim majority. So when you have that, then the Ladakhis also said that we are not happy with Delimitation, we are not happy with the 370 Abrogation. And therefore we want either a six scheduled kind of situation or Article 371 type of scenario by which our jobs and lands and other Domicile identities will be preserved.
1661633962.0-1661662040.0
So to cut the long story short, may I suggest that the ruling dispensation has realized that three years down the line, after 5 August 2019, no one in the entire state of Jammun Kashmir, the Kashmiris in the valley, the Ladakhis and the Khaki is in the province of the dark. And the Jammu Dobras are happy with the arrangement that was unleashed on that day.
1661664330.0-1661724890.0
Now, the abrogation of Article 370 and the reorganization of the state, as I understand it, has also virtually finished off the mainstream political parties because people feel let down by these parties. They feel that they did not do enough to defend them in Delhi. Now, has this led to a political vacuum, and does this mean that it creates more space for the separatists? Or how do you see the political evolution from now on in the well. What I could suggest is that the underlying the revocation and nullification or reading down of 370 and 35 eight was the objective to somehow eliminate the political leadership of the mainstream.
1661725550.0-1661759026.0
That is why the expressions which have been used all through these last three years for them that they are dynasts, that they have encouraged terrorism, they are very corrupt. And I think, I think in all fairness, we can say the same thing. If you're talking about dynasty, what about Tamil NAD? What about, uhisa, uisa has a chief minister who is the son of a politician. I mean, I can give you 15 names of states which are basically Dynast based.
1661759208.0-1661799780.0
Now, with that, what happened with the efforts were made to politically reengineer the ground situation such that in the name of devolution of power to the Panchayat, panchayat elections which were not held for many, many years in the state were announced and they were bought. But as a political scientist, you know much more than I do. I'm not a political animal that devolution can happen, it must happen. Power must dissolve down to this ground zero. But there cannot be a replacement of power at the third table level.
1661800630.0-1661856174.0
You talk about punchyards and then District Development or Block development and then state leadership. Surprising as it may seem to you, and this is a crucial point which is worth noting, that the mainstream who felt so isolated boycotted the Punch and Surpunch elections. But the state government, the central dispensation, then ordered the conduct of Block Development Council elections. And as the viewers are aware, there are ten districts in Jammu region, there are ten districts in the Kashmir region of Union territory of JNK and there are 14 members on each district. So the political leadership and this answers your question, do they feel, the mainstream feel that they are finished?
1661856222.0-1661869740.0
They are not finished. The block developed the district development election. Of the 140 seats in the Valley, the majority ruling party got only three.
1661872030.0-1661916870.0
And this was because the political mainstream made that appear to be a referendum on Article 370 and said so. Sorry, when you say majority party you. Mean I'm saying the mainstream majority parties of J and K, which have been told whether it is the NC or the National Conference or the PDP, they are the majority in that sense. They formed the government all these years, ever since 2000, 1996 to be precise quarter of a century. They treated block or district Development council elections as a referendum.
1661917210.0-1661951140.0
And that was their cry during the elections were held under the Election Commission of India. And what was the result? I mentioned to you. Out of 140 in the valley the ruling BJP got three in the so called Hindu majority jammu, the PAGD, the People, the Lands of Gupta Declaration, which has the book, the PDP, the National Conference, the CPI, M. Awami National Conference, People Conference and the Muslim Group.
1661952070.0-1661994994.0
All of them managed to get 35 of 140 in Hindu. So in other words, this answers your question that August 5, 2019 decision has been completely nullified by the voice of the people. And this is what the government of India and the ruling party in August 2019 said they will be now development. We will eliminate terrorism and we will ensure that the Dynast and the mainstream politicians are shown their door. But that didn't happen.
1661995192.0-1662057470.0
The politicians, the mainstream politicians actually won triumphantly the District Development Council elections and the efforts are now on even today to somehow change the political demography and the electioneering scenario such that things come in favor of the ruling dispensation. My next question actually within that yeah. That is a Delimitation Commission delimitation process. Could I just for the viewer, I just want to explain it a little bit that in May this year the government completed the delimitation process that is the redrawing of the borders of the constituency. So this, I'm told, has resulted in six new constituencies in the Hindu sort of dominated Jammu region and only one additional constituency in the Kashmir Valley.
1662057630.0-1662097380.0
And reports also suggest that this delimitation has not been done on the basis of population as it should be. And now the gap in the number of seats in the Jammu region and the Kashmir region are much smaller. What impact will this de limitation done in this kind of way have on any election? No, I think we need to contextualize this. If we are looking at the collisions between two ideological thoughts, that is one point.
1662098070.0-1662136160.0
If we are looking at in many ways ensuring that democracy remains pulsating and vibrant and legal and legitimate, if we are our intention to ensure that the inclusive and democratic and global nature of Indian society and Indian State remains there forever, then I'm afraid de limitation has undone it. The formation of the delimit. Why do I say that? Let me explain very objectively. There's no emotion in this.
1662136610.0-1662173270.0
Delimitation was frozen for whole of India till 2036. There was a resolution passed by the JNK Assembly when it was in existence before 2018 that delimitation will be done in or after 200:26. That decision was upheld by the high court of JNK. It was upheld by the Supreme Court of India. So therefore the decision on appointment of a Delimitation Commission was in many ways election.
1662174350.0-1662227450.0
It has been done and under which delimitation exercise has been completed. When the members of the Delimitation when the members of the political parties were requested to dialogue with the Delimitation Commission they said on what basis has the number of seats in the JNK Union territory earlier state been increased? From 83 to 97 seats were increased. The members of the Delimitation Commission scattered ascertain from directors of the Deliberation said this was a political decision. Increase or decrease of members in a legislative assembly is a function of that assembly endorsement by the Delimitation Commission.
1662228430.0-1662252338.0
It is not a political decision of the ruling political party of India. Right. Point number one. Point number two as you rightly alluded to the principal criterion of delimitation is population all over India. It has been the experience.
1662252504.0-1662320630.0
Of course there is the factor of contiquity convenience and topography but this is more an exception by the rule than the rule. Whereas what the Delimitation Commission has done, it has been pointed out by the political parties to the Delimitation Commission whom they met, that if we go by the census of 2011, this is what the Delimitation has gone by the population of the Kashmir Valley was 69 lakhs. The population of the Jammu region was 51 lakhs. By that yardstick, the number of seats to Kashmir Valley should have been about 51 and to Jammu about 39. But by the actions of the political leadership in the country and endorsed by the Delimitation Commission now that gap has been reduced in terms of 47 seats for Kashmir Valley and only 43 for Jammu.
1662321070.0-1662360070.0
Which means it's not rocket science. You and I can sit down with a piece of paper and work out what in sick logical term is called a concept of cracking and combining or packing. Cracking and packing. Cracking means the demographic geography. You crack it up completely crack it up and then you pack it such that a benefit comes to a certain geography.
1662361610.0-1662383322.0
I don't need to name what I am suggesting. And that is exactly what has happened. We will see how it moves forward. Kashmiri see the Delimitation Exercise as one more example of an assault. There was a constitutional assault on 5 August 2019.
1662383466.0-1662419026.0
There have been many assault since then. And now this is the electioneering assault. So the electoral arithmetic interviews of the Kashmiris I'm only voicing the opinions of the Kashmiris and the state of Jamal Krishmeiri people on the issues that you have raised. This will have its own consequences. As you know, the Delimitation Commission has been set up under the JNK Reorganization Act which by itself is on the challenge of the Supreme Court.
1662419218.0-1662484640.0
And it may set aside the JNK Reorganization Act in which case Delimitation Exercise is also completely toned down by the adjustment whenever it takes place. But it is a sad, really, really a sad reflection on how the Kashmiris who are alienated, who are in despair, who are despondent, who feel a sense of complete hopelessness, for whom there is a death of expectations, for whom democracy exists only when one moves out of JNK state to the rest of India. Kashmir, which has not seen elections for four years in June 2018 was the last that you had an elected government. Why aren't they allowing elections to take place? The exercise of Delimitation was to buy time even though it is alleged to it.
1662485170.0-1662528682.0
And in that time buying that exercise is over. And there was speculation in the media that elections will probably take place when the next set of elections take place towards November of this year. But I'm afraid I'm a perpetual cynic on Jammu Kashmir in terms of how our ruling dispensation approaches it. It doesn't seem that elections will take place soon. Elections will take place only when the ruling dispensation has done its microscopic analysis of Booth level constituency and how the behavior will be.
1662528816.0-1662560606.0
And if they come to the conclusion the elections will favor the ruling dispensation. They will announce it only at that time and not on the grounds that Kashmir has not had any elections for four years. I. Think same thing applies to statehood. Statehood also, which has been promised on the floor of the parliament the very day that Article 370 was read down, that once situation is normal, statehood would be restored.

Restored in Krishna. Regrettably for the ruling dispensation and the people of India, the normalcy that was talked about does not exist. It has not come about notwithstanding the media, who are bulk of the media who tow the official line in India. And I'm sorry to say this to somebody who's such an outstanding media personality with such strong credentials, but the stories are storylines or taglines or headlines are so manipulated that what you convey is what is termed suggest you false. You heard that expression suggest falsehood and suppress the truth.
1662616642.0-1662655762.0
The expression is suppress your venue, suggest your false. And that's what it is. One small line yesterday or day before, no Kashmiri Pundit has left the valley from August 2019. Which means the August 2019 ensured that Kashmiri Pundits did not migrate out of the valley. My answer to that is a small fact that from 2003 to 2022, the 8 August 2022 when we are chatting, no Kashmiri has left.
1662655816.0-1662659160.0
Kashmiri Pundits had left from 2003.
1662661610.0-1662688160.0
But the media headline is such that they have stopped leaving only after the Article 370 was read out. And this goes to anything. It is such a sad reflection of the manner in which the media is treated. It's so sad to me, who's a hopeless visitor to the state. I go there almost every few times in a year.

Journalism is criminalized. Your journalistic lenchers are branded by what report you are writing and who you are associated with. Journalists have brought forward there's a kind of a coercive ecosystem specifically targeting journalists. Those who work in Jamaica. In the valley.
1662713598.0-1662755460.0
Yes, in the Valley there are journalists who are under the Draconian WAPA and PSA and PLMA. I mean journalists who have credentials. There are journalists who are being stopped at the immigration for attending a routine conference abroad. They're not allowed to board the aircraft. So therefore very unfortunate, because the sadder part is, and I think this I am making a very humble suggestion to you as one of the leading journalists of the country.
1662756070.0-1662796000.0
Indian journalists have forgotten the Kashmiri journalists. Except for one or two reports I have seen of the Editor's Guild of India. It's not that the journalists are not aware of what kind of coercion and intimidation the journalists in the valley are, particularly local journalists, because they're not trusted. Any event that of consequence that happens in the valley, journalists are thrown from the rest of India to cover that event. There are a couple of questions from viewers, so if you don't mind, I'll read them out to you.
1662796530.0-1662824860.0
The first question is from Pewsh Kulstreshta and he asks why was Article 370 introduced into the constitution two years after signing of the instrument of accession? Just a week or two before the constitution was finalized. King Hari Singh was not in charge of JNK at that time. Sheikh Abdullah was, isn't it? That's the question.
1662826590.0-1662853678.0
No, I'm glad that Pier Saba asked this question. You see, the accession took place, as I said on 26 of October 47. All other states, princely states which were 564 of them, they merged their const. Each of them had a constitution. They merged their constitution with the constitution of India and integrated and merged completely with the State union.
1662853774.0-1662888338.0
Union. In the case of Kashmir, let me put it that Maharaja Hari Singh was there very much in 1949. He had not abdicated it he Abigailed two years later. But he signed the Instrument of accession and this was endorsed by Sheikh Abdullah who was without doubt the most popular leader in the Kashmir valley. And he enjoyed support from all Chami Rujis lagaki.
1662888374.0-1662893098.0
Buddhists, christians. Kashmiri. Pundits kashmiri. Muslims. Jammu.
1662893114.0-1662910850.0
Goras. The people from Punjab. People from Pit Panchaar, meaning Jam Punchan Rajori. Then people from Bathurva kashtua Doda, which is the Chadap Valley. So the two year gap is because this had to be negotiated.
1662911010.0-1662958226.0
You see, instrument of exception itself means just one piece of paper, one page cannot reflect relationship between we have to put in place what would be the fundamental rights. This is where there was a problem on fundamental rights. The rest of India not applying to GNK and Sheikh Abdullah was very adamant about it. There was also this question of even today you will not believe that some of the outstanding agricultural reforms of that period, land to landless were done by Sheikh Abdullah. And that's why he was keen that the normal laws of India are not applied.
1662958338.0-1662996910.0
Because normal laws of India have not allowed agricultural reforms to take place even today. Where Jamal Kashmir is a shining example world over of agricultural reform and land to the landlords being given the same tillers land to the tillers, the tillers who were tilling the land. Some of our larger family people had a sex. We didn't have any agricultural land, not my family but they were devoid of him with no compensation. But that was what was Sheikh Abdullah's idea of Nayakashmi where he was socialistic in his nature.
1662997070.0-1663039758.0
That is what attracted him to the leadership of India. So therefore, whatever happened was under the leadership of Sheikh Abdullah. As far as replacement for Harishing was his son narrat Karan Singh, Raj Pramukan who eventually became the resident he was hardly a teenager. I think he was 19 years old when he was a regent. But that system of a regent representing the larger union and the chief minister or the prime minister Sheikh Abdullah was called until 65 when it was changed to chief minister like in other states.
1663039924.0-1663099700.0
So there is also 370 dilution. It is not that it was just three foreign affairs, communications and defense. There were many things which were progressively what Kashmiri is called stealthy constitutionalism through stealth you were able to with puppetized regimes and assembly which was of course not representative of the people because elections were rigged. So you were able to progressively dilute Article 370 such that it was then called by many political leadership at the center as just being a structure, as having no meat on it. So that is how it was diluted and that is why until 5 August 2019 Kashmir was a fraught issue.
1663100070.0-1663135260.0
It is not that Kashmir was like any other state and suddenly it became different. No, already a fraught issue. We didn't touch upon the indices of violence and the militancy but in due course if there are questions, I can answer that. Yeah, I'm afraid we have spent an hour already so I have to end this conversation but it has been a great pleasure having you on this show. Emma Shilka hopes we can have you once again to tell us more about your state.
1663135630.0-1663155982.0
Thank you. Thank you very much for giving me this privilege for these conversations and I'm sure there would have been more questions but maybe another. There are a few more but the time has run out. I can understand. Thank you very much.

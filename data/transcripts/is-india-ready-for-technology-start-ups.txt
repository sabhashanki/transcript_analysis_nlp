Very good evening namashkar and a very good evening to you so good to. See you once again yeah, same here, same here. I can see that you are forever smiling that is how India wants you to be all right? There will be some audience interaction and those those questions I will pose to you if they pop in some offline questions have already come to me that I will pose to you okay? On today's discussion is India ready for technology startups?
1657337870.0-1657365490.0
That is the big discussion we are having today. It's an important discussion as India goes into the Amrit Kal and wants to become a developed nation. Welcome to Kulke. It's a conversation platform where people can learn many things. Like today, many would be learning how to become a successful startup.
1657367110.0-1657411198.0
Kulki is an indigenous social media platform, unlike the others, which are either American or Chinese. So this is a start up effort to bring social media, which is totally at the nearby. This is a show towards a new India. And my name is Palaw Bhagla and I am a science journalist who has covered science and technology for the last 25 years. But the energy I have been seeing in the last couple of years in the young Indians.
1657411374.0-1657452430.0
To take on the challenges like never before is so very satisfying. Our guest tonight today evening my apologies. I'm a television man. I always looked at stuff at late evening so tonight is very easy for me but on this afternoon or early evening is Dr. Anasuya Roy she is a PhD from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi there can be many PhDs who come out from there but not many PhDs go on to have a startup.
1657453490.0-1657487340.0
Not many PhDs are spunky like Doctor Anusuya to take on the challenge during the middle of COVID-19 Pandemic to start a startup for a company called Nanosafe and then to give India one of the first washable antimicrobial masks. I must say, I met her during the lockdown. Complete lockdown. When it was there, she was working.
1657489870.0-1657506750.0
I have also used her mask. It fitted me very well, it worked well. My family bought those masks and they used them. And I make that point. They bought and used them, and they've been very happy.
1657506820.0-1657524598.0
Repeatedly, they have been buying that. But today's discussion is a lot. About how technology startups can succeed or fail in this current environment. Dr. Anusia, thanks a lot for finding time for us.
1657524684.0-1657551374.0
You're a busy person. Let's start off by first telling us what your startup is. Nanoseafe and what does it do, and tell me after that. Maybe I'll ask you a little bit about your IIT carrier. Sure did my frame freeze or no.
1657551412.0-1657567700.0
It'S all right, keep going it's all right. Okay, great. So thank you for that introduction it's a little exaggerated, I must say and believe me, I am not busier than you so you must be a pretty busy person yourself?
1657571450.0-1657606986.0
I did my masters as well as my PhD from IIT and post completion of my PhD. So we incorporated the startup Nanosea solutions. So to begin with so my PhD thesis was on antimicrobial materials, how to turn different types of polymers, plastics, textiles, whatever materials, basically antimicrobial. So kind of extrapolating of whatever research that has been done. During my PhD dissertation, we incorporated Nanosafe, which was focusing which is focusing mainly on making antimicrobial materials.
1657607018.0-1657654138.0
Now, we make a lot of antimicrobial materials depending upon what product, depending upon what application. Mask is one of the applications that too that was made in COVID-19 times. But then we have got multiple other applications in the polymer space, plastic space, paints, cosmetics, as well as coatings. The basis of our technology is an antimicrobial technology effective against all kind of microbes, which includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, et cetera. But the USP of this technology is it is based out of an active copper technology, which is we are the first movers in the market, even in the global market, to have a technology which is based out of active copper.
1657654234.0-1657685370.0
I mean, for people who do not know what is going on in this space, people normally focus on nano silver as a technology. So India as of now imports this nano silver technology from either the US or the UK in large quantities and use it in the domestic market. So we are the first movers in the market to have a technology based out of active copper technology. Nanosilver. We feel the sunset technology, huge toxicity issues are there with this particular technology.
1657685520.0-1657697520.0
And we are also trying to substitute this huge import that India is doing on a daily basis. So that is what our startup does.
1657699730.0-1657714290.0
There's some small little crackle on your voice. Honesty. Can you fix that either? I can't figure out what but there is some crackle. Okay.
1657714440.0-1657736730.0
Yeah, this is better. Okay. Good to hear. But not many people who do a PhD convert their their work, which is academic, into an industrial product. It's the Indian Institute of Technology.
1657736880.0-1657758142.0
Yes, but still there are thousands of people who come out who never are able to convert their PhD into a product. And then I must tell my audience. Dr. Anasia said that exaggerated. Let me add to that even during the COVID and now by Dr.
1657758196.0-1657781410.0
Anasuya is a crowd of a tea and she made revenue that extent. So anybody who's watching the show, please don't get intimidated by what is happening around you. If Dr. Anasuya could become a crowd party during the first of the lockdowns, how the world is yours. You can do many more things and you can become unicorns.
1657781490.0-1657805790.0
And we will talk about how technology unicorns can emerge. And that is an important part of our discussion. Copper has been part of our traditional use. We use copper all the time. So did you get that germ of an idea of using copper from our ancient visitor?
1657806610.0-1657831634.0
Yes, partly, yes. The other fact why we choose copper as an antimicrobial is also because it is also an essential micronutrient. So there are few elements that are required by the human body for unity and growth. Copper is one of them. And the best thing about copper is, apart from being a micronutrient, there's also an antimicrobial.
1657831682.0-1657867214.0
In the other hand, whereas if you look at any other elements such as silver, it is not a micronutrient. So because it is not a micronutrient, the toxicity issues are quite high. There are others in this domain which is, let's say, called titanium. These are all antimicrobial materials where the benefits or the health benefits of such elements were not so high. So keeping everything in mind and understanding the fact that we have to build a material that can replace and have good activity, antimicrobial activity against all strains of microbes, we thought that copper would be the best choice.
1657867262.0-1657889562.0
And also of the traditional use of copper, especially in the Indian subcontext, has a huge sentimental value as well. So that also worked to our advantage. Dr. Ancient, your voice is still having a little bit of a crackle. Is it possible to use a headset or is there another solution available close by else we will continue doing with this?
1657889696.0-1657908960.0
It's just a small crackle there. I see. So what I'll do is I'll try to speak a little slowly and towards inclining towards the mic. Yes, you should speak slowly, but work fast, which I'm sure you will.
1657911090.0-1657944086.0
Now tell me, during the severest lockdown, how did you go about doing your work? It was very difficult. It was very difficult to manage the operations during lockdown. And this lockdown is not second lockdown or third lockdown or whatever. This is the first lockdown that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 23 March.
1657944198.0-1657986506.0
And we started we conceptualized this mask and it was the idea was there first week of April or second week of April, but only on 15th, starting from 15 April, we started our operations surrounding the insect mask. So what happened was because of course, during that point of time, masks were a huge scarcity. The only masks which were available was N 95 masks and surgical masks. Again, non biodegradable had huge issues as well. So these were sold at about 500 $600 in the market.
1657986688.0-1658018194.0
There was no concept of Reusability, there was no concept of antimicrobial nature of the masks during that time. We conceptualized if something can be done using alternate raw materials. So whatever material was used to make a 95 mask or surgical mask, we will not go with that, but use some alternate source of textile or raw materials to build a mask which would be a Reusable and B antimicrobial. So that was the conception. So this is easier said than done.
1658018312.0-1658054586.0
It's like on theory, we were very clear that this is the mask. We want to make this much. This would be the attributes, ABC would be the attributes and XYZ would be the raw materials. But where to source raw materials in lockdown link first locked down, it's like we knew this isn't the fabric that we want. So what we did was we did an extensive of course there would be these fabrics, there would be fabrics existing with some vendors, let's say in Surat or in Gujarat because Gujarat is a very textile rich zone.
1658054698.0-1658085558.0
But how to transport the person with whom we were talking to? So we were making like 200 calls a day to the local vendors so the person to whom we were calling, they would be like indicate how to transport it to Delhi. So that was a huge issue. And then we could not find the same rid of fabric here in the Delhi. Of course in Delhi it's difficult to find but if you go a little bit industrial area towards Noida, then also there will be an interstate of course boundary.
1658085654.0-1658118100.0
So that is a problem. So we had to sneak in through in a truck where there will be PP kits because awareness also was very low at that point of time. So if the guards would stop to check what kind of materials we are transporting so PPS of course is an emergency material everybody would understand. But cloth, normal cloth, the cloth that we use for insight mask is not nobody has the awareness that this would be built in masks. So we had to kind of sneak through.
1658118790.0-1658139050.0
I don't want to go into details on record, of course, but we had to sneak through. Don't worry, I don't want to hear how you did that. End of the day, you succeeded. And you beautifully gave those masks in those worst times. And I must tell the audience, we did a show masking india saving the world.
1658139200.0-1658175830.0
And that was an all in all nari shakti show, where we had a scientist from the principal scientific advisors office, dr. Shalija Gupta and Dr. Anusuya, who featured on that. And trust me, masks were what finally they were called as the social vaccine, or the vaccine that saved the world before the vaccine came into being. Let's now shift a little bit of the gear from your mask and technology to the whole ecosystem of startups.
1658177130.0-1658214546.0
See the whole startup ecosystem in a way part of Philip when prime minister Narendra Modi gave that clarion call from the red Ford startup india, stand up India. Is that how Dr. Anusuya stood up and got counted? No, I just want to share another small realization that dawned on me on the final year of my PhD. So when I was doing my PhD so whenever people does their PhD, so they are concerned about the end product which is typically a thesis, right?
1658214648.0-1658246826.0
So they would accumulate whatever findings they had in this hard bound thesis and they would kind of put their sweat and blood in writing that particular thesis. But while I was writing that thesis, of course I had also had to pass to the same checkpoints. So while I was writing that thesis, I was constantly thinking what will happen to this thesis once I am not here? What will happen to those findings, those research? What will happen to them if I do not do anything with it?
1658246928.0-1658267490.0
Right? So it will just remain as a black and white piece of paper. It will remain as few articles, it will remain as few patents. That's it. But the industry so the sector I worked with is of course antimicrobial, but the industry will continue to kind of import nanosilver technology from outside.
1658267640.0-1658302414.0
Nothing would change. And it's just a standstill thing. So that realization, perhaps coupled with the fact that, of course, startups by the surge of the government, everybody was trying to build a startup. Everybody was trying to do something different. So that time, coupled with that circumstances, we quickly thought that if we can build something indigenous and if we can build something that can solve this particular problem in India, that would be like really, really good.
1658302452.0-1658307230.0
I think that realization came when I was writing my thesis.
1658317600.0-1658329890.0
I think Palavaji just dropped off. I am not able to see him. But in the meantime, I'll just take this question which is posed by Mr. Manish Agrawal. Okay, he's back.
1658330340.0-1658332950.0
We lost you for a couple of minutes, I think.
1658338590.0-1658372790.0
I'm not able to hear you. Perhaps the Mic button you would like to press, I think let me address this question. Did the government help you in procuring and distribution of masks?
1658377650.0-1658387694.0
Yeah. So did the government help you in procuring the masks? Procuring the raw materials of the mask? No. So we had to do it by ourselves.
1658387742.0-1658419126.0
Because at that point of time so it was very early stages. In April 2020, the whole thing was standstill. So there was no office open, there was no policies entering that. If a person wants to make mask, there were no schemes, there were no grants, there was nothing on paper or any policies for that matter during that time. So we had to do the procuring alone.
1658419238.0-1658434346.0
Distribution of masks. Again, it's a demand driven thing. Of course, when we launched the mask, there was huge demand poding in from all the states, from international countries as well. So distribute by distribution? If you mean logistics, no.
1658434388.0-1658449750.0
Then again, we had to do it alone. But the demand was so high that we were able to streamline the process in very less time. So the logistical support also we took help from private stakeholders.
1658455050.0-1658473920.0
But of course, India had one policy at that time that you can safely transport emergency material, COVID-19 material. So masks being an end product, was not difficult to transport. But the raw materials, on the other hand, was difficult to transport. Yeah.
1658482420.0-1658508424.0
So I could can see another question. What was your thought process during this whole episode given that the vaccines didn't arrive just yet? So we knew, of course, as scientists, we knew that the vaccine was arriving, the research was ongoing, of course we knew what stage it was at and we understood that it's going to take a long time. In fact, the vaccines are delivered much before we thought it would be delivered. So they did a wonderful job.
1658508462.0-1658535712.0
But before the vaccines came, of course we had to do some kind of some kind of technology has to be there so that the gene is broken or you are protected at least. So during that time, the only thought process that we had was we have to somehow make this marks. I can see you back again. Yes. My sincere apologies to Dr.
1658535766.0-1658569420.0
Anasuya and to the audience. There was a power breakdown and simultaneously, obviously, the internet went off and now you can see it's against these odds like this that Dr. Anusia succeeded even during the severest of the lockdowns when there was not a soul to be seen on the roads. And now we were talking about the larger ecosystem of startups.
1658571440.0-1658602040.0
So is India really ready for technology startups? And I'm not talking of digital technology, see business process startups which have become unicorns of late, so many of them are, in my opinion, far easier than the kind of stuff you are doing. So is it easy for a technology startup to succeed in this environment?
1658605740.0-1658645970.0
So if you look at the number of startups in India and kind of do a technology startup versus a digital startup analysis, of course digital startups and their success stories are much more higher in number than technology startups. Well, that doesn't mean that technology startups are not successful or they are not there in the market. Of course they're there, but the fewer number of unions in that space the reason why I think that technology startups kind of are not so much fast paced my screen just had gone blank. Can you see me or hear me? I can still see you, yeah.
1658646500.0-1658709204.0
So I feel the reason why technology startups are not very prominent in the unicorn club is because a technology startup has a lot of challenges that a digital startup does not have. For starters, a technology startup will be based out of a technology and a technology needs to be rigorously tested and certified and run through multiple rounds before it is placed in the market. So there is a constant change which is required for a technology startup in a service based or in a digital startup that is not there. Also, the second point I would like to mention is there is a huge difference in the requirement of capex expenditures. So while a technology startup may invest in either an inventory or a manufacturing line or something that can make the technology process robust, digital or services based startups or especially the SaaS space, do not require such capex expenditures and they can switch very easily.
1658709332.0-1658766460.0
So one day they are having a different model, the next day they can tweak their revenue model and tweak their business model to suit the needs of the market that is not there. The other thing what I feel because I'm typically an academician trying to go into the business space is the fact that technology startups are often founded by most of the time is founded by a technology person and in most cases they are not very aware of the market research they are not very aware of the product market fit. So that is why many at times they miss this angle or this whole game behind the market research and therefore end up with a product which does not have a good product market fit. How easy it is it for startups to get financing?
1658771920.0-1658811780.0
It depends. Actually, again, financing is something that is an entirely different ball game and if you look from an investor point of view, so an investor would always want a ten x growth in five x lifespan. That is the normal rule of thumb. A lot of products or a lot of technology products especially will not kind of have that kind of hockey stick growth. So for them funding will be very, very difficult because the investor would not see growth in these kind of startups.
1658811860.0-1658859976.0
But with startups who can kind of promise that there will be ten x gains or eight x gains over the next 510 years, that would be very easy for funding to happen to those startups. Apart from that, I also feel that the personal story of founders is also very important. Investors would look for a team that are energetic, they have this fire in their belly and they can make things happen and be a gogetter. If you miss any of these things then the investor might not be very keen on funding you. So whenever you are kind of asking for funding or asking for looking to raise money, I think the best thing that you can do is put yourself in the shoes of the investor and see what you have to offer to the investor first.
1658860078.0-1658893270.0
Yeah, one of our people in the audience, Manish, is asking did the government buy your masks? Did they help in procuring? I know you were constantly selling them on Amazon and Flipkart, et cetera, but did the government help you in any of that process? So Palavadi, when you went off I took a couple of questions from the audience. I answered for.
1658895640.0-1658919580.0
Let'S go ahead and continue the discussion on why are there still only a few thousand startups? We are talking now 75,000. Okay, seems like a large number, but we are a country of 1.3 billion.
1658922640.0-1658937600.0
To a science journalist like me that number sounds small. Yes, definitely. And how can we help more startups? Because that's also a question coming from the audience.
1658940180.0-1658964030.0
I think Sake is asking that there are startup ideas. How can they take them forward? Okay, I would like to counter you here with the statement that India is the third largest startup economy after US and China. So we are doing good. But of course there's a lot that has to be done in this area.
1658964400.0-1658981600.0
Of course, I understand that the ratio between 75,000 startups and 1.3 billion citizens is still skewed. Of course there's a lot that needs to be done, but we are moving at least in that area, in that path.
1658984260.0-1659021864.0
I think the gap lies in startups typically in tier two or tier three cities. If you still look at tier two, tier three cities, the number of startups in those cities are not at par of how it should have been. So I think the local government or the local authorities or stakeholders of startup ecosystem in that state should apart from the capital, the state capital should also look into the small cities and try to imbibe a culture. So this is basically a culture. This is basically something that has to be imbibed at an early stage.
1659021992.0-1659053348.0
And entrepreneurship is actually something that you do for money. It's not something that happened to you. It's basically a lifestyle. This lifestyle has to be adopted, this lifestyle has to be loved to be an entrepreneur. So I think in tier two and tier three cities the focus on, you know, achieving a job or in some MNCs or companies is much higher than what you know, than being in a startup space.
1659053434.0-1659084960.0
So that mentality has to change. Of course, it takes time of course to a mentality to change, but that is happening. But the pace has to be a little more faster answering socket question which is how to actually start a startup. So the step one would be if you have an idea, understand whether that idea is patentable or not. If it is patentable, always go for a patent because in the long run it is very crucial.
1659086820.0-1659136850.0
Apart from this, if it is a technology startup, then you look for incubators around you. You look for search in Google about the best incubators in India or Delhi or whatever and then try to approach them and say this is an idea that I have. Help me make a business plan out of it. Help me make a proper business case so that I can file for a government grant, I can file for government funding or private funding, whatever. So the first step would be to, first of all to have an IP around that idea and the next step would be to reach out to your nearest ecosystem, be it an incubator or an accelerator, and talk to them and find out how to execute the same.
1659138740.0-1659167480.0
Does that answer enough for you? Suck it or do you want more? Put them out into the chat box and we will certainly take them. I can answer in step one, step two, but that will take a lot of time. So if it does not answer your question, you can always write to me at Anasuria at Direct Nanosefsolutions.com and very specifically I can guide you through the different steps.
1659169820.0-1659218076.0
Again, I come back to the issue about number of startups Anasua in this amrit Kal we need so much more technology infusion to reach a stage where we can go ahead. I agree, I can't agree more. I mean if you see that India has everything what is required to build a good technology startup and to compete with the likes of us but what we typically do here is see what is the US doing and then copy here. It should be the other way down. Ideally it should be the other way.
1659218098.0-1659288556.0
Down by Javarto Marya startup Javar Nikara but they are actually taking these steps to go in for a full fledged industry and a business model and I must tell you, you are talking to a thoroughbred Marvadi we know how to do business and our families have done business for centuries. They have succeeded and thrived and I really want our young startups all over the place to imbibe some of that and also do some scientific social work, also some charities, some philanthropy because I believe you've also been doing simultaneously alongside with your startup some work on that tell us a little bit. So this is a small initiative that we took. So we realized that there are a lot of slum dwellers in vicinity of where we live. So I live in a case called Malga.
1659288748.0-1659327116.0
So it's a very Porsche area in South Delhi but if you just look around also there will be like smaller houses, smaller slum type of area where people and there will be also people who are living under these foot bridges. This is very common in Delhi so foot bridges there will be a lot of people. So what we did was we thought that we will open a community kitchen in lockdown, of course and we thought that we will have basic raw materials that is needed. So first we started that we will give them raw materials like rice and dal and oil and whatever. Then we thought that why not we make a meal out of it so that they can have it?
1659327138.0-1659380816.0
Because if you are hungry and you're good during lunchtime we normally do this so why not make a meal out of it? So we made kitry, we made kitchery, we made this alu Kasabse and we distributed the first time we distributed it was like very thrilling for us. It was very inspiring to kind of see that we were in cars, we were going in different areas, we were distributing. So the first time we did it hamil Atlaggy we thought that we will do it every Saturday. So till now we run this community kitchen in which we make typically kitchen and the sabzi and we pack them and I didn't say this on record anywhere, but I do not cook but I pack them myself so it takes me around 2 hours to pack these boxes but I anyways do it.
1659380838.0-1659427884.0
It's a very nice therapeutic exercise that I do and then I take my car and a couple of other people along and then we distribute these to all these people. So it feels very good actually at the end of the day you feel that you are giving back to the society. It's a small effort, I know it's a very small thing that you do but still it feels like the thing, the other thing that we do is we give books for class ten, class twelve to people who needs in that area. So any kid who is in school and they need books of course now the academic session has just started so we were able to give complete set of these books to about ten students in that area. Excellent.
1659427932.0-1659499040.0
So simultaneously with the startup you are also doing charity and philanthropy to take the people along because unless you have people in your community and your surroundings who are along with you it certainly doesn't give the satisfaction of doing what you are doing. One more question which came to me offline is that how do entrepreneurs and people like you and you have not probably faced it but many others have when you come up with face to face with failure because the rate of failure of a startup is far higher than the success, how do you manage? It's not like I haven't faced failure, maybe in different aspect, in different time, in different circumstance but I have faced failure many many times in my life. What best I can say is a failure is only failure. If you look at it in that way it is only a learning for you.
1659499190.0-1659533040.0
So even if, let's say, Nanoseaq was was a startup which is not which was not kicked off, it is still in not making revenue out of it. I, at the end of the day, would learn a lot in that journey itself. And maybe I can, I can build a second startup based out of the knowledge from which I have, you know, I have gathered in this pearl stage and then put it in a different startup and then make the startup run as well. So you just learn from your mistakes. So if you're failing and not learning that is not the way.
1659533110.0-1659557400.0
So if you fail you have to learn from your mistakes, you have to understand what to do and what not to do and then extrapolate them in the next one and that is how you grow. Also people who grow have to fill 100 times and only at 101st time that person is growing. That's also a question which Abi is asking what keeps you. Motivated.
1659560780.0-1659640320.0
See, you have to be happy in what you do motivation is something that cannot be from an external source that's what I believe if I do not run nanosafe because antimicrobial technology is a forte if I don't build a startup around my forte, then who will? And if I have the best chance to succeed in this I have the best chance I am from a premier institute, I have contact, I can survive, I can do this if not me, then who? So I think that is the motivation that keeps me going I feel that I have the best chance to change the scenario that India is right now facing that is this huge import I feel that if I'm not able to do it, then who else can? That is the spirit we want that is what we want other startups to imbibe that is what we want the youngsters to look at that is what we want which will keep India going forward can you give us some simple vital statistics of Nanosafe? What is the kind of revenue, what is the kind of revenue flow, et cetera so that people get a little perspective that palaw is not Fibria?
1659645640.0-1659676952.0
Well, let me give you some statistic in some other way, because NSafe was our first revenue based product. When it was launched, of course it was locked down all over. So we got orders from all the states of India. So all the 23 states of India ordered our masks. But apart from that, what was overwhelming was the fact that the next day when the product was launched, we were started with calls from the US and the UK of all other countries.
1659677016.0-1659709850.0
Why I mentioned these two countries in particular is Indians look up to these countries as a role model for them. And they had ordered and safe mask and they saw the technology, they understood the technology from me, and they kind of congratulated me for building such a product. And UK was having a huge corporate crisis then. And the fact that these people trusted on India to procure a technological product is something which was an achievement for me. More than more than the revenue any day.
1659710700.0-1659745510.0
So that is the kind of achievement that makes me proud not in figures. Also this one obvious question which came to me offline was and I don't believe in this but I have to ask you because it came offline is it easier or harder for a lady who's heading a startup to succeed? Does the gender make a difference in a startup? Yeah. I can see why we do not agree to this.
1659746440.0-1659776160.0
Well, for me, I don't think that gender makes any difference. To put it out there, point blank, I do not believe that, being a woman, I have faced problems, I have faced biases. No. Yes. Some days I feel that the industrial area, there is no woman around there, but some days I feel in a boardroom, I'm the only woman who's sitting out there.
1659776230.0-1659800096.0
But I feel proud of it. Instead of taking it as a disadvantage, I feel proud of the fact that Balabaji, who also visited the NSF mass production facility, there was only two women out there. I think one was me and the other one was Dr. Shanja Gupta. That is a very proud feeling.
1659800128.0-1659842340.0
I don't think there is any problem in being a woman entrepreneur. Of course there are aspects in which family comes into playing, in which you are supposed to look after your offspring more than the mealy counterpart that is there, but that can be tackled at home very easily. And apart from that, I don't think there are any more challenges. I feel women are more powerful than men, but that doesn't make either of the gender weak or strong. Any larger message for the audience which is listening to us or to people who want to go into this risky area of startup.
1659843720.0-1659903924.0
Yes, palavaji, because you asked me a question of financials, you asked me a question of revenue. Let me just put it out there very clearly that whatever for a medium startup, not even a large cap startup for a medium or a small startup. Also, if you start earning in revenue or if you raise funding as well, the amount of money that you can take for yourself will be much, much higher than what is being paid to you as a salary. In salary, what happens is of course there's a security, there is something if you can sleep well, the risks are much, much lower. But in a startup, if it clicks or if it transforms even to a minuscule amount, the amount of money that you end up with is something that you cannot even put in the same scale as in comparison with the job.
1659904122.0-1659930592.0
So I feel this is the right time to run a startup. I think because of these kind of small issues, a lot of people back out from incorporating a startup. But this is the right time for a startup. Government has a lot of schemes, lot of grants, there are a lot of private investors as well, there are a lot of foreign investments also. So this is particularly, I feel, a right time to start a startup and boost India's economy in a macro scale towards the end.
1659930726.0-1659975260.0
One question for you. If you were to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi for one thing, which could make the startup ecosystem 100 x from today and fulfill my desire for Ya Del Mangay more, what would that be? I think the primary thing would be of course there will be people who will be looking for much higher things. Like the recent letter that was written to Prime Minister Modi from the union founders was listing in international international forum and all that. But my ask is a little more in terms of the ground.
1659975680.0-1660004120.0
What I would like to see is in tier one. And in tier one cities, of course, the awareness is quite high, but in tier two and tier three cities still there is a very there is a lot of confusion about what to do and what not to do in a startup. What are the legal implications, what are the tax implications? And coming from a background, of course, different people will have different backgrounds. Coming from academic background and going into this is very, very complicated.
1660005340.0-1660046630.0
It's very complicated to look at or to understand what is happening in this space. So if there can be a very easy let's say let's say an easy helpline number where people can call and ask what to do and what not to do in these kind of I mean, how to start, for example, socket's question only how to start a starter. And this can be addressed by a person in the help line who will explain in a very simple term. And then then it may be helps because there is a lot of questions that these guys have and they have no one to turn to. So maybe that will motivate them to actually incorporate the startup and that will eventually the number of startups, as your dil mangamore says, it will grow.

I think we should be calling this conversation to an end just now. Always a pleasure and a delight speaking to you, Dr. Anasia. There's so much to learn from you and there is so much for people in India to learn from you. There's no way we can relive how hard it was for you to start a start up during the lockdown and succeed.
1660079860.0-1660108250.0
My own desire would be that you should write a book at some point how you went about this and how you succeeded in it, maybe do a short film, et cetera. Leave people to remember and do it fast before memory is fade and because already COVID-19 is fading in the memory of people. Thanks a lot for speaking to us and giving us.
1660110380.0-1660130272.0
Yeah, sorry to interrupt. Just that you mentioned about this story. There's a book called Eaves against the Odds. So these are journeys of 25 woman entrepreneurs who kind of made it big. So I submitted a story long back.
1660130326.0-1660158564.0
So I'm not much of a story writer, of course, but I thought that I'll try my hands on this and I submitted a small kind of five pager Journey of the Unsafe Mask and it's getting published now. So this book, Eves Against the Gods will be available in Amazon and I call the Kindle version will also be available. Just that you mentioned. I thought that was just kind of I've done that exercise. Excellent.
1660158612.0-1660192320.0
But again, five pages not enough. I'm sure the experience during the lockdown and the learning from that is a lot more to be to be told. The story, the success story is is immense. And certainly during COVID and post COVID India is grateful to the amount of work you did and the hard work you put in. Thanks a lot for joining us and thanks a lot for the insight.
1660192480.0-1660231360.0
A lovely and a good conversation in which we also saw how even in 21st century India we face dropouts because of electricity problems and internet problems. Yet we have people like Dr Anasuya who make things happen and make India move and help us keeping India safe. A lovely audience out there. A few questions which came offline and online. I'm sure this is not the last conversation I am having with Dr Anasiya.
1660231700.0-1660296864.0
I wish you turn into a unicorn very soon and give India the first technology based unicorn and not a digital unicorn and I'm sure you can do that. But thanks to the lovely audience, we had a great interactive session and I'm so happy that Dr Anusuya was able to spare the time and give us insights on how India is starting up and standing up all towards a new India being conducted on a startup platform which is totally indigenous. That is what satisfies me and gives me a lot of pressure. Thanks a lot to the audience and thanks a lot, Dr Anasia Roy. May Nanoseafe become a big multinational and give India and you more credit for that.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for having me.

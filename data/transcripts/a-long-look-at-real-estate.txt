Thank you, Priyanka, for joining us today. To everybody who will watch this, who is watching right now and watch in the future, I would like to introduce Priyanka Kapura panelist to you. Priyanka is the vice president of research at anarak Property Consultants. And we're doing this roundtable with Priyanka as part of our Naya Door campaign, where we're looking at the development of different sectors, sectors within the Indian industry since independence, and looking at what are the major milestones that they've achieved, what are the major government regulations that have come in. And if we can do some crystal ball gazing to the future to see what the future holds, will be doing some of that as well.
1657591590.0-1657633662.0
So. Thanks, Bianca. Again, if you could just sort of take a look back at the past when we talked about realisticities when I was growing up, when my parents were young and looking at buying property, this is something that brought a lot of noviceness into your decision making because it was not well structured industry for a long time. If you're in a major market like in Delhi or NCR or in Mumbai, you're always worried about the underworld. They worried about cash transactions, they worried about title deeds being dubious, but not has changed since then.
1657633716.0-1657670026.0
So now we're seeing a lot of listed companies which are supposed to be brand name developers. We're seeing property consultants like yourself giving advice to buyers on how to go about these decisions. And if there's like a formalization of finance, we have now laws about if your property has been developed on time, doesn't meet the promised timelines, what is the right to recourse that you have as a buyer? So can you tell me what the journey has been like and what are the main reasons for change? Yeah.
1657670048.0-1657691282.0
Hi, Tanyang. Good afternoon to all. Well, yes, you are right in saying that there has been a lot of changes in the Indian real estate sector since the turn of the century. Today it is almost unrecognizable from what it was earlier. The Wild West story.
1657691336.0-1657732602.0
It was before. Today we can use words like organized and transparency, which was not there earlier. Then structural reforms and policy changes like demo demonetization, the Real Estate Regulation Act, rarer came in GST, they've come in and helped clean up the market. And the large corporate houses have become very active in the real estate sector now. Now, the times that you were referring to the mafia, ETCA, they mainly existed before 2008 when Indian real estate was very, very unregulated.
1657732746.0-1657767034.0
So landlords, they became developers overnight to make fast bugs. And it was such players that ruled the roost. Now then, until the global financial crisis that hit in 2008, there were plenty of funding and there was plenty of funding for, you know, the developers. And many builders, they went overboard with, you know, creating more and more housing for a speculative market. So basically it was a market which was built for short term investors and actual end users were nothing but helpless victims of the system.
1657767232.0-1657799822.0
And we had markets like MMR and Delhi, NCR, which were the top markets for speculation. Meanwhile, the southern markets, including Bangladesh, Innai, Hyderabad, they have always been driven by end users. So prices there remained largely under control. Then between 2008 and 2015, the sector, you know, it, it remained unregulated for a long time. But you know, we saw the entry of some of the large corporate houses.
1657799886.0-1657827166.0
You know, they came into the picture, they started entering the market. However, the market remained inefficient. But because these organized players were now gradually coming in, the government also finally intervened with a lot of policy changes and regulations came in. The bad apples were weeded out, consumers remained. They were no longer just the victims of the real estate market.
1657827348.0-1657854120.0
Black money even today does find its way in some transactions in tier two and three cities. But now most of it today it has gone indian real estate is no longer safe haven for black money. So while I'm talking of these changes, they are still a change in motion. But we cannot compare today's market with the one that existed in previous years. And this is most evident from the data.
1657854570.0-1657889630.0
The data says that the value of real estate under construction today has increased from 94 billion in 2009 to USD 251,000,000,000 in 2021, which is a 2.7 times increase. So in this period, we saw the share of residential real estate grow from 49% to over 84%. So yes, the house market is expanding rapidly, but one thing is certain that it no longer lacks the direction that it did earlier.
1657893270.0-1657914794.0
You briefly mentioned the huge impact that Demonetization had in the real estate sector. It was, I think it overnight changed this automatic haven for unaccounted money. So you've been in the sector for a long time. Tell us some stories from that period. What have you heard, what has changed that?
1657914912.0-1657966890.0
What are sort of client stories you've heard in the past which you no longer hear about? Okay, so what we saw in November 2016, it was overnight, things change and especially for the real estate sector, if I may say so, demonetization happened and suddenly the industry somewhat came to a standstill because it kind of demonetization exposed the real estate's excessive dependency on the cash for transaction. If we talk today, there has been more than 40% fall in cash transactions since Demonetization. We still have a lot to wait. But what is the scale of cash transactions?
1657968670.0-1658020838.0
Well, at least in the primary market now we have primary market when I talk of when we do a direct purchase from the developers. So in that there has been more than 40% to 50% almost like I would say today, overall 40% down cash transactions have gone down. But in the primary market it is almost negligible. Now, mainly because the primary market is directly we are dealing with the developer and it is only the second sale market when we buy it in the resale market, when we buy a resale property, that we see some cash transactions happening. But otherwise overall we've seen there's been a major decline.
1658021014.0-1658076954.0
And I would say then immediately after that, Rare came into existence and in 2017. So that was a very important reform in Indian real estate. And from that point, it is a reform that safeguards the interest of buyers and makes developers answerable for timely delivery of the project, for any misuse of funds and the quality of construction. Now, if you look at today the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs data, there are around 85,593 real estate projects that are registered under Rare across the country, across various states. Also 8500 505,000 real estate projects.
1658077002.0-1658116330.0
Okay, so 90,000 projects, almost yes, 90,000. Projects registered under Rare. And to look deeper, then we saw that Rare was mainly to hear to the buyers what their complaints are. They were the major sufferers from the mischievous acts of various developers. So we saw that over till date, 96,000 complaints have been addressed by the Rare authorities across the states.
1658116480.0-1658132014.0
So this is the change that we are seeing brought in by Rare. Various quotes. If I could just jump in junk as a question people, listeners might have. Rare is real estate regulatory authority. Yes.
1658132132.0-1658145940.0
And could you tell us. If someone. Has a complaint against the builder, what sort of complaints can they submit? Why should they make sure that they probably register under Era? What are the sort of the course?
1658148550.0-1658216458.0
Rare is different across various states in terms of there have been certain the guidelines that have been laid down by the center, but because land is a state subject, so every state has formulated their own laws, but in line with the centers framework. However, the Rare, since it has come in. So now, earlier we had problems like project delays, we had problems in the quality of the construction. Then the developer promised something but did not adhere to his promises. So these are the complaints that buyer like you or me can go ahead, go to the lodge, a complaint against the concerned developer with the Rare authorities and then the Rare authorities, they take it into consideration and they try to dispose the case as soon as possible.
1658216624.0-1658223290.0
So that is what has changed. Buyers have a free say now they can come forward and launch their complaints.
1658226350.0-1658260920.0
I just bring up a question that we have from an audience member. This is about what is the success of Rare and what changes do we see here? This is from Karthik and he also wants to know, do you see where do you see Rare heading and do you think it will make life for buyers easier? So, yes, with the advent of Rarer, we have seen many changes. Buyers as I said various cases have been disposed of by the rare authorities of respective states.
1658261770.0-1658338142.0
Buyers have managed to while it is still a thing in progress. But yes, buyers have got there what to say the complaints that they've lodged against the quality or against the timely delivery. So they've managed to pull the developer to quotes or they've also their concerns have been addressed by the rare directly where rare authorities have mandated for the concerned developer to either to pay a compensation to the respective home buyer or with respect to that. So there have been cases where homebuyers have been satisfied maharashtra has been frontrunner in this gujarat they've been cases where homebuyers have been satisfied, their complaints have been addressed and the developer has had to address these concerns and pay in terms of compensation to the concerned buyer. And as far as your next question goes that where it is headed.
1658338286.0-1658378030.0
It is still a work in progress. We cannot say we've achieved 100% success with rare coming in. There are cases that despite the rare authorities mandating the developer to pay a compensation to the buyer they've not done it but it's still a work in progress. But we are seeing a lot of progress I would say today and the buyers have now gained an upper hand and no developer can now take a buyer for a ride. It's not as easy as it was earlier and various quotes have come forward.
1658378100.0-1658401060.0
The Apex Court has come forward. Supreme Court has given various various sentences to developers where they've had to pay to the concerned buyers. So it is a work in play I would say but still a lot has happened and a lot will still need to be happening.
1658404250.0-1658471126.0
For anybody in the property market right now they should make sure the public is registered under error make sure that the developer is responsive to yes you are right. Besides, as a buyer, we need to be very careful, very diligent, and do our research well with what kind of project we are going, because that makes a huge difference and especially what kind of a builder we are going with before making a purchase, because it's easy to put the blame on others. But we also have to be quite. Diligent, due diligence, like the standard with the Latin phrase right by your beware, right? Okay so yeah we talked about the large changes that have happened how Demonetization was a shock to the real estate sector but it's paid off dividends at least there's some good developments because of that has brought a lot of clarity and transparency to buyers.
1658471238.0-1658485360.0
But I want to know as a consultant when you look at buyers now do you think the profile has changed in some way? Do you see more young people now putting money properly? Do you see more women buying property?
1658489970.0-1658533258.0
How do you see the buyer profile change? So if we look at the past decade or a little more, then we'll see there's been a, you know, phenomenal shift, not just in the overall buying patterns, but also in the age of property buyers. So what we saw until the late 90s, most Indians prefer to buy home using their savings. They didn't opt for home loans. So as a result, the home buyers at that time were mostly in the age group of 45 to 55 years or maybe even closer to retirement because it was only by that time they could have accumulated sufficient wealth to support their property purchase.
1658533434.0-1658569418.0
But in this period, what happened was younger Indians, they had lower savings and they mostly kept away because they were also very cautious about the bank loans. They thought them to be risky at that time. And banks were also very reluctant to lend 70% to 80% of properties overall purchase back then. Yeah, but then gradually in the 2000s, we saw the age bracket of property buyers began to drop. It started coming down to 35 to 45 years.
1658569584.0-1658609110.0
Home loans gradually were readily available then. Home buyers also warmed up to using borrowed funds rather than depleting all their savings. Plus there was the added benefit of some tax benefit that they gained if they took home loans in this period. What happened was that the banks and the other lending institutions, then they began to focus more on the younger borrowers. So by late 2010, we saw that buyers were largely aged 35 to 45 years and also 45 to 55 years.
1658609260.0-1658632234.0
But the share of the home buyers in the 25 to 35 years age group was minimal at that time. Then. However, now what has gradually happened is buyers did come in in the 25 to 35 age group. They were there, but very minimal, I would say. But then came the pandemic.
1658632282.0-1658658950.0
You know, that changed completely. The, you know, ola uber millennial generation. I was going to ask you about millennial schools. I'm a little below before 35, and I don't know if I could simplify a house. This Ola Hooper millennial generation suddenly became very enthusiastic and they came to the forefront of buying a home rather than renting.
1658659450.0-1658693534.0
Renting was there. Where are these millennials buying homes? Because the OLAW millennials live in the big cities and big city homes. So coming to that, what happens is this millennials, of course, they are looking at the top seven cities because that is where they will live, and they will live and work over there. But they are also seeing options in the tier two and three cities, their hometowns.
1658693582.0-1658725898.0
Many millennials, we saw that they were also those who could not afford to buy in cities. We saw that suddenly post the pandemic, they started looking at their hometowns where property rates are far more affordable. So this is the change that we saw post the pandemic. And you can say various reasons. I won't say just of course, pandemic being one of the major exigencies crisis that changed their outlook.
1658725994.0-1658761046.0
But also there were other factors. The stock market went down as soon as COVID came in 2020. Then we saw job losses were there. But then a new perception came in, Keith, there should be financial security. And that financial security they saw in a physical asset, which is real estate and most importantly, residence, because that is where they started spending most of their.
1658761068.0-1658789714.0
Time. To tell of incidents in Bangalore we saw during as soon as COVID came in, a few months down the line, the tenants the landlords were asking their tenants to vacate. So that time many of the millennials felt helpless. They all helpless in the sense that suddenly they've been asked to vacate. So where will they find the next property?
1658789832.0-1658825610.0
So that's the time when they realize that owning our own home, I mean, owning a home is far better than renting. We also saw this in our survey. Anoraka conducts these surveys half yearly. We conduct consumer sentiment survey and we've seen this changing trend. So what we've seen is that in the survey, latest survey, we saw the financially strong Indian women are also coming forward and they've become a very powerful home buying demographic.
1658826190.0-1658855400.0
Their preference earlier women were only part of the decision making aspect in the home buying process. But today women, they are investing into real estate. And we saw that from the pre COVID survey. We saw that there was a stark change in the number of women preferring real estate over gold or FD or stock market.
1658859770.0-1658891040.0
That's a very courageous decision also because you're looking at long term income potential, what you have in hand now. Yeah, correct. So these are the changes in terms of gender or age related. So yes, there are a lot of young buyers now coming forward and millennials are the new home buyers that we've seen in recent years. Hopefully I will qualify into that millennial category at some point.
1658891650.0-1658904690.0
We have a lot of questions, especially from Karthik. We have quite a few piling up. But before we move to what Karthik has asked, is one that's slightly related to what you were saying. It's from the rain. He's asking is Indian real estate still attractive for investment?
1658904850.0-1658913560.0
Because data shows rates reduction in developed countries. I guess he means the value and I hope you mean that the value.
1658917610.0-1658957974.0
Yeah. So now if I look at Indian real estate, it's still very attractive, but it is still a good investment option and there is hope for growth in the future. We need to see from various aspects india is a developing country and we are seeing infrastructure projects still coming up. There is a lot of development still happening all around us, even in the cities. We can't say all cities have fully developed and there's no more activity in terms of infrastructure development happening there.
1658958092.0-1658989758.0
So as long as we see there's a continuation of developments happening. Real estate prices will continue to rise and proviso. Yes, there is a condition that you need to invest at the right place, at the right location, with the right builder and the right property type you need to see. So there are various factors that you need to consider before putting in your money. Not all micro markets may fetch you the same returns.
1658989854.0-1659015302.0
Even a location within a micro market may fetch you. Can you define micro market? I think we're so used to this jargon that micro market by micro market. I mean a locality, a particular locality. Let's say Anandarian, Mumbai orley these are different locality, two separate localities.
1659015446.0-1659046734.0
So when I say a locality so within a locality itself, you will need to do your due diligence. Go with the right project, go with the right builder and opt for the right property. And then definitely your investments will appreciate in the future. So VIRIN has a follow up question. I don't know how much detail you want to go into but which is the right market in your opinion?
1659046782.0-1659082490.0
Then VIRIN, do you mean by city versus rural India or between cities? Priyanka, if you can give some color on that. As far as investment in terms of cities are concerned, the top seven cities including your NCR, MMR, Bangalore, Chinnai, Hyderabad, Kolkata they continue to be the main hotbeds for investment. Why? Because that's where most of your employment opportunities are presently.
1659082650.0-1659127866.0
But as I said earlier, one must identify the key locations in each of the cities and figure out where new infrastructure will cause prices to rise in the near and distant future. And today plots plotted developments have seen a remarkable increase in demand. And so you could also, one with a relatively lower budget could consider investing even in plots in the cities, mainly in the southern cities. We are seeing a lot of plotter developments coming in. So one could consider these cities for investments.
1659128058.0-1659159826.0
But now, if I overlook this and besides the top cities, some of the leading tier two and three cities you'll have your Lucknow, Japur, et cetera that are also worth considering. Because this is where infrastructure is coming up. And besides the cities and locations, investors must know that property sizes, price tags, they are likely to grow in the future. But not all options are created equal. So one has to do their due diligence.
1659160018.0-1659196014.0
Very you're talking only about women buyers. Shape wants to know what is the best time to invest in real estate and should one take a loan or should we wait and save and then invest? And you touched on this earlier about how change now. Yeah. So if I look from a women home buyer perspective, I would say, as a matter of fact, from an investment perspective, real estate now is a good time to buy at the right location with the right builder.
1659196142.0-1659258950.0
I repeat myself. Women, they enjoy a lot of benefits, I must say, when they come forward to invest in real estate from bank home loan rates, the rates for the women are less as compared to those given to men. Many banks follow this and even when you pay your stamp duty and registration charges to the state, even in many states, even those are less compared to when men register in their name. So women do enjoy certain benefits and obviously one of the main, I would say key point for women investors is that it does give them a financial independence and if you can, then you must do it. Okay, we have a few questions on investing in not just residential but commercial real estate.
1659259530.0-1659294034.0
I think over the last few years individual, we've always seen corporates and companies and large firms do this. But now individuals are thinking about buying up space in a mall, a retail space or an office building. Their opportunities now for fractional ownership in real estate, do you think that this is compared to residential? Is this an easier market or a tougher market for individuals to get into? What are the things they should be careful about?
1659294232.0-1659338990.0
Yeah, so if I say in terms of commercial investments, yes, there's been a lot of interest growing. If you look before the pandemic, it was a very fruitful period when many small time investors also got into the commercial market. It was only during the pandemic time when obviously everybody was working from home. So there was a dip in demand for commercial properties. However, if we look forward and commercial sector is going to grow, there is going to be a lot of demand not just from the corporates, but various sectors are coming.
1659339060.0-1659388406.0
ITeS is there, it's always been the frontrunner in occupying commercial space, but other sectors, startups are coming up to occupy spaces. So there is going to be growth in demand for Grade A office space across the cities. And this eventually will bode well for the investors, because as demand grows, obviously their appreciation, your investment value, will increase in the times to come. And there has been a lot of hiring by the ItIts sector. So to accommodate all these employees in the Post COVID world, now, when offices have reopened, they are occupying new spaces or renewing their lease.
1659388538.0-1659468390.0
So a lot of activity has begun in the commercial front as well and more so because demand for grade A office space has gone up post the pandemic because safety hygiene has become a very paramount concern for both the employer and the employee. So a lot of demand is growing for these grade A space which have been low on supply, but now developers are also pushing supply in this category and going forward we will see a lot of demand. With demand going up, the appreciation as well is likely to grow in the near future. Okay, so for an average person who wants to invest in commercial property, do you think it's smarter to do it to actually buy property and then lease it out? Or do you think a financial routes like investing in REITs is real estate investment trust for those of you where you can invest, like it's similar to buying up a unit in a mutual fund, but in real estate instead of stocks.
1659468470.0-1659516202.0
So is that easier, better, smarter decision? Yes, REITs has come out to be a good option, especially because if you have as low as two lakhs to invest into commercial real estate. So it definitely has given a lot of opportunities to the retail, the small individual investors who previously never got into commercial because commercial always asked for bigger investments, which was not everybody's cup of tea. So yes, REITs is one of the option then. Now we are also seeing a lot of fractional ownership coming up.
1659516256.0-1659585150.0
It's also a sound way of getting into real estate wherein a particular property is owned by multiple buyers. However, again, in that case as well, in fractional ownership as well, you need not make a very huge investment, but at the same time, even whatever you've invested, every penny is worthwhile for an investor. So the best option would be to go for a player to opt for properties with again a good builder or the fractional ownership. It also helps what to say like if you are going with a player, look for the sound player. Don't opt for just anybody who's giving you showing you high returns, luring you with high returns in the future.
1659585300.0-1659611894.0
Do your due diligence. There are various consultancies that give you the right way. They will show you the right way forward and you can avail their service, especially for areas where you are not at. Residential is far easier to invest than commercial and commercial real estate. So it's better to also commercial is.
1659611932.0-1659650882.0
Harder to exit, I think. Yes, there are many startups who provide these services as well. But as I said, not every startup is going to give you the returns that they promise you to. So please do your due diligence and go with the right player who can give us sound advice on your investments. Okay, going off on a different tangent here, I want to ask you about affordable housing.
1659651026.0-1659680080.0
There is a very large government program called Sadhan Mantria Siojna which is meant to build affordable housing for the poor, for rural poor, for urban poor. And these are large infrastructure projects, right? What do you think that does to the real estate market? What is the sort of addition of units? What does it mean for investors who might see the prices of their own homes change in some way?
1659680610.0-1659732080.0
What do you think is the impact of a program like this? So Pradhan Mantria VAS Yogna it has very much changed the very definition of affordable housing. And I would say that before this scheme was rolled out in 2015, affordable housing per se was looked down upon, I would say. But with this Yoshina coming in, there was a lot of respectable tag given to the affordable housing. So under the scheme, buyers with under various income groups were, you know, they get the they are able to buy their dream home and where the center helps through their various schemes and.
1659734850.0-1659782398.0
They. Come and help you in terms of the subsidy schemes that they've launched under this program. So one can avail and even in the top seven cities buyer in the affordable category, meaning you know, the lower income group or the mid income groups, they are able to purchase a home because the prices in the top seven cities has been on the higher spectrum for such buyers, but under the PMA. So now such buyers can come forward and avail the benefit. So it is a very noble scheme that has launched implemented by the present.
1659782484.0-1659830320.0
Government and what are sort of additional homes that will be built under PMA by where is the largest concentration of them coming up. So obviously the top seven cities, the work, as I said, is still in progress, even under PME and they have made significant inroads into the cities and there have been various changes across cities and multiple people have come forward to avail to have a home of their own under this scheme and rural areas also it has penetrated very well.
1659833650.0-1659877598.0
The people in the rural areas are availing the benefit and many have got a home of their own and they've benefited immensely by this one. Another benefit that has happened was the government scheme of housing for all by 2022. So that scheme, when it came under that scheme, the government laid a lot of emphasis on the affordable housing sector. So housing is the basic need of every individual. So the government realized this and they launched this initiative of housing for all by 2022.
1659877764.0-1659921702.0
Now, with this launch of this scheme, the government also realized that they alone would not be able to complete that mission of housing for all. So they needed private participation. So for that they rolled out over the years they've rolled out various incentives for the affordable housing and we saw a lot of private participation coming in for affordable housing projects. There were several projects that were launched. In fact, until the Pandemic, the supply in the affordable sector across the top seven cities was the largest.
1659921766.0-1659954626.0
It was almost 40% of the total supply each year until 2019. And then 2020 things began to reverse again, despite the incentives that the government continues to roll out. So there has been a dip in the supply. The supply share has come down to almost 20% today out of the overall. 20% to 25% today out of the overall, you know, new launches that is happening in the top seven cities.
1659954738.0-1659990366.0
And this share that has dropped is largely because the Pandemic has hit this buyer class. The. Most the target audience of the affordable homes buyers, let's say, from the MSME sector. So they've been hit by the Pandemic. So ultimately, the builders had to change their strategy in the private sector and they started launching projects in the mid and the premium category.
1659990478.0-1660029198.0
So the mid meaning 40 to 80 lakh range, and the premium segment meaning 82, 80 lakh to 1.5 kilo. So this is where now the supply has increased, but affordable housing has seen a major dip. But as I said, demand for affordable housing remains the strongest even today. It's just that buyers have gone into a wait and watch mode and once they are out of the economic impact of the Pandemic, they would probably come forward to buy because they are in a wait and watch mode. Yes.
1660029364.0-1660051810.0
Okay, so we've talked a lot about how to make a decision about buying real estate. But what happens when this tends to happen? Not as often as it used in the past, but it still does happen that your builder is not delivering on timelines. They're not, the project is not. They say they give you the project by a certain time.
1660051880.0-1660091060.0
It's been like two or three years, it's been hasn't, or the quality of the construction is not what was promised to you at the beginning. So what does the buyer do then? Well, as you must be aware that there are lacks of units that are stuck homes that are stuck or heavily delayed across the top seven cities. Our Anaroc research indicates that there are about 4.80 lakh heavily delayed homes. And these homes, they were launched in 2014 or before that.
1660093190.0-1660146574.0
However, now with the government intervening and the various financially strong, capable developers coming forward so, you know, there has been a major, you know, turn of events in the last two years. You know, even during the Pandemic, you know, we saw almost one and a half lakh homes get of these home stock homes getting completed in the last 910 months. So that's a huge number. So now, as far as what has happened is that there are several large developers. We have the Swami Fund of the government, which is swami Fund is the special Window for Affordable and Mid Income Housing fund which the government created.
1660146702.0-1660171786.0
And we also have the government run NBCC, which has taken charge of many of these stuck and delayed inventory. Right. And they are now completing these delayed projects. But obviously that is not enough. So a lot of all home buyers problems are not solved by mere completion of the project.
1660171888.0-1660194260.0
There are other factors. So a buyer, if he wants, if his concern is not being addressed, there are various platforms where he can register a complaint. First is, of course, with the rare home buyers. They have that legal option. But apart from that, there are various other legal options.
1660195030.0-1660235760.0
A home buyer can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 against an errant builder. And within two years, of course, from the date of dispute, then he can also register complaint with the Competition Commission of India CCI. And the builder is misusing his dominant position in the market. And the CCI, it looks into the builder's actions and in case of any unfair practice, it can impose a heavy penalty on the builder. Then another recourse is to file a criminal case against the builder for cheating breach of agreement under the Indian Penal code.
1660236930.0-1660264162.0
Sorry. Indian penal code. The homebuyer can issue a notice to the developer and approach the criminal court. If the notice remains unanswered, there are multiple ways where a home buyer can come forward and take legal actions. However, it is a cumbersome process of going through this legal hassle.
1660264226.0-1660285920.0
Yes. Okay. And one last question also comes from Kartik. He says China has been exporting real estate driven growth story and some of the real estate firms are now going kapoor, what are the learnings for India? Okay, so as we would say that the learnings are customers.
1660287490.0-1660318410.0
Earlier, the builders, they took their customer for granted, they took them for a ride. But today you cannot do that. So one of the main learnings is that you cannot take your customer for a ride. You have to address, you have to give what you promise. And above all, the developer, he has to see that he's moving ahead with the times, what the consumer is demanding, what the buyers are wanting.
1660319150.0-1660341534.0
So that is where they need to focus on and they are doing it now. If you see the demand supply gap is narrowing down. Earlier it was the mainly developers. They launched projects according to their in some categories, budget categories only. But now they are following demand.
1660341582.0-1660383146.0
So they are coming up with homes that are based on the consumer demand. If I take the COVID for an example, during the pandemic, before the pandemic period, small size homes were in demand. So builders essentially launched projects that were smaller in size because it would fit the budget of buyer. But post COVID, the demand changed. Suddenly people were looking at bigger homes, they wanted amenities, certain set of amenities which previously were not so much in demand.
1660383258.0-1660431946.0
So then we saw that buyers immediately sorry, the builders immediately changed their strategy. They moved a step ahead and they started launching projects with relatively bigger sizes, homes. And same way they have adopted technology to move with the times. And those who want to stay in the market have realized that they have to be swift in their strategy, business strategies and in their overall product that they give in the market. But I think one of the also the reasons that we see real estate companies in China particularly going bankrupt is because they were over leveraged.
1660431978.0-1660457960.0
They borrowed too much money which then they're not able to sell stock in time to pay back a loan is that a problem that you see happening in India? Do you think developers are heavily leveraged? No. As I said, things have really changed now. Developers, they've realized that they are definitely not over leveraging now.
1660461530.0-1660516698.0
They know in terms of the right product, where to launch, how to launch, and they are looking at that steps. They are moving with cautious. For instance, NCR market, for instance, if I see the Q two, the April to June quarter trends in NCR market, developers realized that there is a lot of supply in NCR market. So they took a back foot and they launched very few projects in the NCR market, even though the demand is very high there as of now. So developers are taking, they are very laser focused in completing their projects rather than bringing out new supply that in the market.
1660516784.0-1660554214.0
So they are moving very cautiously so that they remain in the market and they are not wiped out because any sort of misadventure by them could lead to their own disaster. So they are being very careful. Okay, so we're running out of time. One last question is, since we're in the Nanda campaign, is to look at the future. So what do you think the government needs to do?
1660554252.0-1660577920.0
What do you think developers need to do to make the market more robust, mobile, friendly? Okay, as long as you know the market. The main reason why the market has done well is of course, first reason is in the post pandemic world, home ownership has become priority for many people.
1660581250.0-1660615894.0
So housing demand is there. Now, to stay relevant, developers will need to focus on what consumers are asking for. As long as they keep the demand supply gap minimal, they will do well. And in fact, as we are seeing now, there's a lot of demand for branded developers. So we have a lot of these leading listed and large developers who have come forward and launched several projects.
1660616022.0-1660663570.0
And the best part is that they are launching projects based on consumer demand in terms of which segment needs more homes and in a particular locality, what type of a project will do well and where the demand is coming from. So they are doing a lot of research before simply launching projects. So this kind of change has come in and branded players are seeing phenomenal success in their housing sales. So their quarterly results show that they are doing really well even during the pandemic. So there's a lot of market see housing demand will continue.
1660663740.0-1660706278.0
If I look at the numbers, there is a housing shortage in the country, acute housing shortage. If I look at Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, it has estimated shortage of 30 million homes by 2022. So there's a lot of shortage. It's only where the developers are able to bridge the gap between the supply and demand. They will see success and housing will continue to be a priority for individuals, and they will look at it not merely from an investment perspective, but it is a physical asset that they would love to invest in.
1660706444.0-1660740090.0
That is why housing will continue to do well. At the same time, it will see steady growth. We will not see any haphazard growth like we did in NCR or MMR in the early 2000s. We will not see that kind of haphazard growth. We will see a steady growth with realistic demand, by expectation, by the investor or buyer, that we will see that kind of temper.
1660740170.0-1660749906.0
Steady growth tempered yes. Is what you're expecting, which is good for all of us. We all need a stable rise to the top. Okay. Thank you so much, ma'am.
1660749978.0-1660756454.0
Thank you so much for your time. And thank you for audience for your questions. Take care. Have a great day. Thank you.

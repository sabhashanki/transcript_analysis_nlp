Hello and welcome to the second episode of Open to Question. My guest today is Anil Swadoop, a former union coal secretary who later became union education secretary. An is officer of the 81 batch. He belongs to the Uttar Pradesh Garda. He has worked closely with former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh and Mahavati and has served under both former Prime Minister madam Mohan Singh and the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
1656114818.0-1656155380.0
He helped set up the Rashtriya Sastya Bima Yogana, for which he was widely applauded both here and abroad. He is also the author of Ethical Dilemmas of a Civil Servant. And not just a civil servant. As a great believer in the promotion of best practices in government, he set up the Nexus of Good Foundation after he retired from service. With his varied and wide experience in government, both in the country's most populous state and at the center, he is eminently suited to discuss what is today a hot button issue the Future of Jobs in India india is currently suffering from a serious unemployment problem.
1656155910.0-1656205038.0
The Modi government's demonetization move in 2016 paralyzed the informal sector, industrial output fell and jobs disappeared. The hasty implementation of the goods and services tax in 2017 proved to be another blow that slowed the economy and impacted jobs. And then millions lost jobs. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, india's unemployment rate crept up to nearly 8% in December 2021, according to the center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, an independent think tank. It was more than 7% in 2020 and for most of 2021, according to Khashik Basu, former World Bank chief economist, who was also a former chief economist of the Government of India.
1656205214.0-1656222550.0
And I quote him this is way higher than anything seen in India, at least over the last three decades, including the big economic crisis of 1991 when the country did not have enough dollars to pay for import. So what is happening on elsewhere?
1656224810.0-1656249278.0
I am also myself surprised. COVID has become an excuse, an additional cause for unemployment. But I think the problem happened before the arrival of COVID If you look at the numbers, as you pointed them out, the GDP itself was not growing at the rate that it should have grown. And as per the Oaklands law or even otherwise, if GDP doesn't grow, employment gets impacted. And that's what has happened in India.
1656249374.0-1656278634.0
Now, you have listed out a couple of very prominent reasons for this lack of growth in India. One of course being demonetization, the other being the hasty implementation of GST. As far as the second part is concerned, GST, I think World War whenever GST is implemented, there are problems. To begin with, they were teasing troubles and I think they are getting over it. So I don't think GST is a problem as on date and in the coming years it will ease out.
1656278752.0-1656319638.0
But that's not going to solve our unemployment problem. GST may have caused a bit of unemployment in between, but problems relating to unemployment, the foundation thereof, if I can use that term foundation, was demonetization. Because let us look at the sectors where employment happens, whether it is happening there, because sometimes in our quest for understanding at a macro level, we don't go into the details of why of the problem and that's why we can't find solutions to the problem. In my understanding, apart from agriculture, of course, that is a great employer. The biggest employer in this country is the infrastructure sector, the construction sector, if I may be more specific about.
1656319804.0-1656343098.0
And that sector has suffered phenomenally. It is recovering a bit, but a bit doesn't matter. It has to recover big time for employment to increase. The second sector, which is probably to my mind totally ignored, is the small scale sector. We have also become so fond of big things, flashy things that can hit headlines, that we are only bothered about large industries.
1656343274.0-1656368834.0
And if you look at the data, I am not an economist, but whatever I've heard and read about it is that larger industries don't really create a lot of employment. It is the small scale sector, the mediumscale sector that creates employment. And we aren't even talking about it. It's not even in the discourse, we are not even discussing it. And since I handled industry at some point in time in my career and I'm in touch with a large number of small scale industries, they are in serious trouble.
1656368962.0-1656403954.0
Of course, the double whammy of demonetization and GST hit them quite badly. But apart from that, there are many other issues relating to unemployment or the small scale sector that is impacting the sector. To my mind, these are two very prominent sectors where the government does emphasize both the building and the construction sector, as well as small scale sector where employment can actually pick up. One point probably, which you may have considered but not mentioned here. One of the indicators of growing unemployment is also the pressure on MNREGA workers there.
1656403992.0-1656439680.0
The pressure has increased quite phenomenally. And finally, if you look at the labor force in India, since I was at some point in time directors in labor welfare also, and I don't think numbers would have changed much, almost 90% to 92% of labor force is in the unorganized sector and we seem to be focused only on the organized sector. And when I talk in terms of large scale industry, that's the organized sector. We keep cooking up numbers to say more people have joined the provident fund and things like that doesn't really matter to my mind. The fundamental issue is acceptance of existence of a problem.
1656440530.0-1656476140.0
If we push the problem under the carpet, that all is wet surf sangasi, so it won't work. Let us try and understand. First accept the existence of a problem of unemployment, then go into the why of it and then work out an action plan to overcome it. It has to be a very comprehensive plan taking into account the steps that need to be taken to revive the building in the construction sector as well as this monstrous sector. I was actually going to come to this unorganized sector, which, as you said, is 85% of the workforce in the country.
1656478750.0-1656499040.0
What I'd like to know from you, since you've been in governments for well over three decades, is that why have successive governments paid so little attention to this section, this 85%, apart from schemes like the Narga scheme that you just mentioned and similar such schemes in the past.
1656501090.0-1656516934.0
Let us understand the necessity of Narayga. It's an employment guarantee scheme. It is not employment generating scheme. Let's try and understand the difference. That is, if a person doesn't get employed elsewhere, then he has a guarantee of certain minimum things.
1656516972.0-1656538506.0
That's what MNREGA why don't the MRGA number should be used for saying that people have got employed because they've not got employed. So to say it's merely a guarantee till the time they get unemployment. Now, coming to the fundamental issue that you asked, the informal sector. Informal sector does not necessarily mean that these guys are unemployed. They are all employed.
1656538698.0-1656565734.0
They are defined in the informal sector because the necessary Social Security cover that is mandated under various laws becomes applicable to that 789 percent of the organized sector. The rest of them don't get covered. Doesn't mean they're unemployed. Large number of them either self employed or elsewhere where they don't get covered. I mean, if the Stipulations I remember are correct, if there are more than ten people employed in a particular entity, then only they go in for Provident Fund.
1656565852.0-1656588974.0
If they're less than death, it's not that they are unemployed, they're not mandated to join the employment Provident Fund. So let's keep that definition apart because that definition is based on Social Security. If he can focus on the employment part, I mean, obviously every worker should be given Social Security. But the question here is Social Security comes after he gets employment. Whether that employment is happening or not.
1656589012.0-1656612158.0
That is the key factor here. During the pandemic that we just mentioned. Also, even salary and jobs rank according to the CMA. And studies by the Azeem Pramji University show that young workers 15 to 23 years old were the hardest hits during the 2020 lockdown. Why were they the hardest hits?
1656612334.0-1656635834.0
Because, you know, COVID hit demand. When demand gets hit, manufacturing gets hit. Manufacturing gets hit, employment gets hit. So I'm not too concerned about what happened during COVID because that is something that happened beyond a control and we couldn't do much about it. The question is, now that COVID is stabilized, so to say it's not that rampant, what are we doing now?
1656635872.0-1656650286.0
That's the key question. And what happened before COVID arrived? I'm not sure we should be discussing too much about COVID because no one could have factored for what happened in COVID. I mean, you can always criticize this didn't happen, that didn't happen. But I don't think it will help us.
1656650388.0-1656663394.0
What will really help us? What went wrong before 2020, before COVID arrived? Because COVID has been used as an excuse for lower GDP growth rate and lower employment rate. Let's put that aside. Okay?
1656663432.0-1656683114.0
Let's accept the fact that because of COVID GDP did not go up the manner it should have, it won't have. So did unemployment. The key question is what happened before 2020 and what is going to happen now? So let's not spend time on COVID because COVID was bad time world over world over employment impacted, world over GDP impacted. So be it.
1656683152.0-1656698238.0
But that's done and tested. How are we preparing ourselves for the future? Since if I understood you correctly, the topic was what next? Yeah, okay. To understand all this, can we just go back a little in time?
1656698404.0-1656717586.0
So when India liberalized her economy in the early 1990s, there was an expectation that the private sector would create the jobs that were needed. Why has this not happened? I mean, we are three decades on. And no, it is incorrect to say that the private sector jobs were not created. They were indeed created.
1656717778.0-1656747630.0
Probably as many were not created as were anticipated. Yeah, if you look at the employment rate before 91 and after that, I think there is an uncomfortable amount of improvement in absolute terms, perhaps in percentage terms, since the entire volume of population grew, probably the entire population could not be absorbed. I mean, that is a given. But to say that liberalization did not impact employment would be wrong. I think it did impact.
1656749090.0-1656776406.0
Let us understand why did the employment did not grow at the rate that it was thought to have grown? It should have grown. One, I think all the investment that came in was not as much employment generating as you would link capital formation to employment. Normally, if you say for every rupee that is invested, so much employment should be generated. It will happen only if you have labor intensive units coming in, if you have large industries coming in.
1656776428.0-1656811714.0
As I keep saying, I'm not against large industry, but large industry and unemployment do not have a direct relationship. So small and medium industry, that focus that should have been there for small and medium industry, every garment has been responsible for that. That is one. Number two, which has been recognized with the current government, but not much seems to have been done is the fact that the nature of skilled labor that was required to be absorbed in the industry and service sector, that skilling did not happen. So you have a lot of people doing bas and MAS, and they are good for nothing.
1656811752.0-1656844240.0
They're not employable. Whoever is skilled or not skilled, they're not employable. So you have a labor force that is not employable, and that is again, unfortunately gets recognized in the National Education Policy announced in 2020. That policy clearly brings this aspect out that we are educating children who are becoming students but they are unemployable because they're not skilled and for a variety of reasons that have been mentioned in the report. So what really needs to be done is and I had told Dr.
1656844690.0-1656872738.0
Kasturi Rangan when he came to meet me, I was an education secretary and a he was formulating the policy. I said with the policy you should have a clear cut action plan outlining what needs to be done, how it will be done, who will do it by, when it will be done. Unfortunately, the national Education policy which took seven years to formulate that document, it's a brilliant document, does not have a detailed action plan. It does have an action plan which is not detailed. So what has happened is they said this needs to be done in case of skilling.
1656872754.0-1656912350.0
And skilling is very important in the context of employment. You talk to industry, which I do, they want certain set of skilled personnel that are not available and there are so many people who are available to be employed but they are not skilled appropriately. So as I said, skilling is the key. So one is the focus on small and medium scale sector, the other is skilling. And then of course, if you recall in my opening statement, as I had suggested there also skilled labor would be required is the construction building in the construction sector that employs the maximum, if I remember the numbers currently or almost 13% of the labor force with the highest is in the building in the construction sector.
1656912430.0-1656941022.0
That sector has collapsed. Now, it's not only because of COVID COVID of course added to the misery but it started collapsing before that. Now there's a purpose sort of a logic here. This building in the construction sector got oiled by the money that was not accounted for. Now, I'm not saying that money should become available for oiling this building in the destruction worker sector because what Demonetization did was and rightly so, it sucked out that black money.
1656941076.0-1656964974.0
Of course it's gone back and told back into the market. But fact of the matter is to begin with it brought tremendous pressure on that. Now, let me expand this a bit because we are now looking into future as to what clearly can be done in terms of generation employment, taking buildings that construction work in and do. I mean, I live in no doubt, I don't know where do you live? You will see so many unfinished buildings.
1656965022.0-1656993962.0
No, yeah, it's a tragedy because that's an investment that has been made. There is a cost to the delays that are happening but they are standing there now we have this ratties that have been set up for settling disputes. If I were in the government I would assign rare to settle the disputes relating to each of the construction that is happening here. Let us try and understand whether the delay to be done. We did it in coal where everything had collapsed.
1656994026.0-1657017346.0
We build it through a legislation. It can be done in the construction sector also. But it will have to be very detailed and it will not hit the headlines tomorrow. You know, the problem is that we are so on the headlines tomorrow that we don't go into the details. So if we have to find solutions to construction sector then we have to sit with each of the project and find out the cause of that and come up with a package so that that site is revived.
1657017378.0-1657023026.0
Now, what will that do? Construction will start. Demand will increase. Demand will increase. Manufacturing will increase.
1657023058.0-1657033370.0
Employment will increase. It will create a virtuous cycle. But we are allowing it to happen. Courts are deciding what needs to be done with this. Courts are not for the purpose of development.
1657033710.0-1657053110.0
They are there to decide on an issue. No, for development purpose, a proactive action needs to be set up. Again, if I were in the government, I would suggest set up an empowered group that looks at each of these projects and then find out why are they held up. And pinpointedly say that these are the reasons this can be managed. This can't be managed.
1657053130.0-1657068626.0
I'm not saying all sectors, all projects will be revived. But I'm certain 20 30% projects can be revived. Because in my understanding, many of them are not on account of the fault of the promoters. They're either COVID happened or something happened. So let's work out a formula.
1657068738.0-1657080326.0
We do that in case of industry. Don't we come up with a revival package of industry? We did that in case of coal in power sector, it has been done. Why can't it be done in the construction sector? I've touched upon only one sector.
1657080438.0-1657084140.0
Similarly, you can look at the medium and small scale sector as well.
1657087230.0-1657109890.0
In India only I don't know roughly about 15% of the jobs are in the organized sector and only a fraction of that is in the government sector. And yet we see today. You know, I mean I was traveling in up during the recent elections there. The biggest demand is for government jobs. Why when they represent such a fraction of it's very simple.
1657109960.0-1657126600.0
It's very simple. Government jobs give you job security which private sector doesn't give. You know, I had I mean, I'm digressing a bit to illustrate my point. I had paid Rs10,000 to Big Bazaar for shopping in next twelve months. Okay?
1657127210.0-1657144990.0
Now that Big Bazaar has shut up I don't know where I am going to get that money from. But that's only 10,000. But when I visited one of those so called decaying Big Bazaars I spoke to some of the employees there and they are shocked. They don't know what has happened to them. They haven't got their salaries for three months because of no fault of theirs.
1657145330.0-1657157378.0
So that's why everyone wants a government job for security. It has its flip side. There are problems in it, but that's why they want the government job. But since you touch upon this, let us understand. Where does the employment come from?
1657157464.0-1657164418.0
It comes from the private sector. It comes from the public sector. We've touched upon the public sector so far. Sorry, private sector so far. Let's look at the public sector.
1657164514.0-1657185098.0
What are the areas in which government creates employment? Unfortunately, a large number of jobs are vacant at a time when there is so much unemployment. Government is not selecting people. Now, recently the Prime Minister announced the mission. Now, why should we have a mission when it should have been done on a routine case?
1657185264.0-1657206462.0
Someone should be held responsible. And let me tell you, it because from the top. Since I was coal secretary and after I left 2016, even at that point then I had to fight to get directors of various companies, coal companies. Why should anybody sit on files of directors who have to be appointed? Why should there be a delay in appointment of CMD?
1657206526.0-1657228860.0
You know the day the CMD is appointed, you know when he's going to go. Three years, five years, whatever is the tenure, you know, why can't we do the selection before that? So it begins from the top. Similarly, as you come down in each of the departments, there are huge vacancies that are in existence now at a time. I'm not saying it's going to make a big dent in the unemployment problem, but at least whatever can happen should happen.
1657229230.0-1657239578.0
Thousands of vacancies are there in government, both center and state. Why aren't they being filled? Why should they be a mission? Now, look at army or military. For the past two years there have been no recruitment.
1657239754.0-1657256914.0
Now, government also creates job. I'm not saying that government should be employment generating machine, but whatever employment that you can provide, you should do. It's not happening. So get down to it. If I can interrupt you for a minute because I'd like you to explain this.
1657257032.0-1657281234.0
For instance, what you're saying is absolutely right. In February this year, I think the Minister concerned on the floor of Parliament said that there were eight lakh vacancies in government. And now you have the Prime Minister announcing ten lakh more jobs. So what is he referring to? Those eight lakh plus two or six creating?
1657281282.0-1657298058.0
No, he did not even see when he did ten lakhs, he would have accounted for those eight lakhs and the likely vacancies the next one and a half years. So I don't think there is an additional creation. That's my understanding. I will be totally wrong. But it is the vacancies in government jobs that's the tragedy.
1657298234.0-1657301650.0
The second question is why are these vacancies not filled?
1657303910.0-1657321366.0
That's the question. I'm also raising the point is vacancies are known. COVID was not known. We spent hours and hours over COVID when we had no control over COVID. How about having a discussion on asking this question that you are asking as to why weren't these vacancies fit?
1657321388.0-1657345550.0
I don't know. I remember when I was secretary committee, I was after everybody that jobs have to be fit. And we did manage to do a few things. But the point is that the missionary zeal that is not getting reflected now should have been there earlier because in any case there was this unemployment problem. So at least say a million jobs would have been filled by now.
1657345700.0-1657368502.0
So the question is we keep discussing intellectually, academically and all these academic discussions are around what should be done. My discussion I normally have a discussion on what ought to have been done, has not been done. I'm not even asking for the moon. Let us travel on the ground and see what needs to be done. So the first job that needs to be done is identify what can be done and it should be done.
1657368556.0-1657394430.0
Stop talking about make in India. See, the point is we live in an ethereal world and we start talking, everything is fine. You look at look at what targets we set up for make in India. Whether in terms of sorry again, having been in government for so many years and having an insider's view, what is the real reason for this reluctance to indifference. Indifference.
1657394930.0-1657416470.0
The question is official level no, see, in garment, the drive comes from the top. What are the priorities that happens? How did Swachhabara Tabayan happen? Did any I mean, government officers certainly do it, but the drive came from the top. The mission which the Prime Minister talks about, very rightly so, comes from a missionary.
1657416890.0-1657432006.0
You can't expect civil servants to be missionaries. So if there is a drive for Swachhabara Tabayan, yes, an officer can drive that. But if there's no drive from the top, we live in a democracy. Let's understand this very clearly. Civil servants are tools.
1657432118.0-1657452800.0
The same tool can perform. They have demonstrated that they can perform when things are bad. The question is, where is the drive? So the question is that if the priorities are such and that's why I keep saying when you go into the why of an issue, you won't get publicity next day. Because why means going through the details of it and it will take time.
1657453750.0-1657474726.0
Now, who has the time? I want the headline tomorrow. So if you want headline every day, then things will not happen on the ground. Instead of work reflecting headlines, it is headlines followed by you had this whole lion of matinee wake in India doing rounds all over the world. No one has evaluated what actually happened and we use anecdotal evidence to demonstrate that it happened.
1657474908.0-1657487840.0
Empirical evidence is to the contrary. Absolutely. The manufacturing sector is in a really. Poor under make in India and the document is there. They had planned a manufacturing growth of 412% to 14%.
1657488290.0-1657517400.0
What are the actual numbers? Actual numbers are 4.2% in 2017, 555 point sorry, I'm sorry. The actual numbers are I had those numbers 2.8 in 2016, 4.4 in 2017, 4.6 in 2018 and 3.9 in 2019. This is well before COVID So what are we talking about? We can't have this announcement being made every year.
1657517850.0-1657539070.0
And I hope this announcement of the mission for employment gets implemented on the ground. It can be done. I mean, when the Prime Minister decides he has demonstrated that we want things can be done on the ground, have been done on the ground. And I keep saying swachh bharat GST and fintech the technology in financial transactions. All this has happened in this country.
1657539220.0-1657548400.0
Look at the way road sector is flourished. Why are jobs not a priority? I don't know. You ask them. I don't know.
1657548930.0-1657554078.0
I can't answer that question. Why is it not a priority? I don't know. Education. I knew because I handled that sector.
1657554094.0-1657572358.0
I know because education impact happens 15 years down the line. Who's bothered about 15 years? Everyone is bothered about tomorrow. And hence, despite talking loud about education, the actual allocation to education in real terms, school education actually came down. So since I didn't handle as a sector, I can't say what is the reason behind it.
1657572444.0-1657589530.0
Someone else may have to answer that question. Why? Okay. Earlier this year we saw young people from Bihar and up especially, going on the rampage to protest against recruitment to railway jobs that were taking place. And right now we are watching the opposition to the Ugnipat scheme.
1657589610.0-1657599262.0
What is this? A sign off? People want jobs. We are overplaying this. I don't think this is happening for the first time.
1657599396.0-1657621394.0
It's happened on a number of occasions in the country and some of these states that you know are infamous for such stone pelting. And how does it help anybody? Stone pelting? It's a tragedy. I tweeted once all those stone pelters and arsonists should understand that if their name gets recorded in any than in any case, they're not going to get any government jobs because police verification is required.
1657621442.0-1657649040.0
What is this going on? I mean, I can understand their angst, I can understand the protest, but damaging public property and stone pelting? I had said earlier also, and I had said it again, this is not going to help anything. Frankly speaking, since you mentioned that I haven't gone into the details of this. But my little understanding of the scheme is it is better than doing nothing.
1657649410.0-1657677126.0
You can always say there could be better options if you let the government two years, no recruitment, another two years, no recruitment. I think it's much better off than that. Secondly, I mean, when government comes up with something, obviously there can be some problems with that. There are no perfect solutions to any problem in the world. So let's live with it for a while, see how it works before jumping to the conclusion state of and start burning trains and burning buses.
1657677238.0-1657687638.0
It doesn't work. I'm not sure whether the response to this is an appropriate one. I don't know whether it's political or otherwise. I have no clue. But I don't think that really helps.

Whereas fundamental issues relating to unemployment need to be addressed. But this is not the way to protest about it. No, but if I could just ask one more question, a more pointed question on this. Some of the young men.
1657704230.0-1657708820.0
You'Re fine. I can hear you. You can hear me? Yes. Loud and speak.
1657709590.0-1657736894.0
Okay. So some of the young men who were opposing this scheme, the young scheme, they said that they had actually already given the physical exam as well as the written exam. And they were waiting for the interview. And so now they wanted to understand whether they would have to go through the whole process. Again, they were upset about that.
1657737012.0-1657757554.0
No, I agree with you. Complete interviews for those who have already gone through the first two stages. No, I totally agree with you. The government should respond to that query and they should explain what will happen to those that have given the written examine interview. But pelting stones and burning buses is not going to get them the answer.
1657757752.0-1657777226.0
The issue that I'm raising is slightly different. I totally sympathize and empathize with those that are looking for job, those that have given written exam, those that have given interviews. I think someone in the government should listen to them and give them an answer. But does pelting stone of burning buses give them that answer? No, that's my personal view.
1657777248.0-1657799418.0
People would disagree these days in the country, if you don't agree with somebody, you are his enemy. So be it. I couldn't care less if wrong is wrong is wrong. So instead of I don't justify that. But I do understand that if they have a genuine issue and since having been part of the government, I have been in such situations.
1657799434.0-1657815074.0
You know, when the CBSE paper leaked, all hell seemed to have broken loose. No? So as secretary government of India, I came to the fore and answered those questions. So someone should come to the fore and answer those questions, whatever be the consequences. So government should answer this.
1657815192.0-1657828326.0
As to those people who are given an exam, given an interview, whether they will be considered or not. If not, then why not? This dialogue should happen. You know, sometimes I believe I understand that this dialogue doesn't happen. And that's where the problem is.
1657828348.0-1657843790.0
You know, if you look at the farmer's legislation also, I I thought that was a wonderful legislation. Again, my personal view, people may disagree with it, but I think we didn't have a dialogue, we didn't have a conversation. We didn't take. Stakeholders into conference as we should. Same as the problem with the agneweer part.
1657843940.0-1657871334.0
I wish stakeholders had been taken into conference. I wish this program and I will stand corrected if I'm wrong. I wish this scheme would have been put on the portal and public opinion sort before taking a final view on that why I'm saying that because we did precisely that. When we did cold block options, when we tried to sort a cold mess, we did it because we took every stakeholder into confidence. Doesn't mean that we all agreed, but they knew what was coming to them.
1657871452.0-1657900650.0
So despite disagreement, they traveled along with us. So, the fundamental issue is, as I say, that for an idea to practify and sustain in a democracy like ours, it has to be politically acceptable, socially desirable, technologically feasible, financially viable, administratively doable, judicially tenable and emotionally relatable. This is last dimension. What added when this farmland isolation happened? Emotional relatability means that you may have a brilliant idea with this politically acceptable, socially desirable, technologically feasible, so on and so forth.
1657900730.0-1657942714.0
But if the stakeholders do not accept it, then you may have trouble. So at least make an effort to get the stakeholders on board. My hunches, and I hope I'm wrong, my hunch is that in this weird scheme, agnew and agnipa scheme, I don't think stakeholders were taken into confidence, as was the case in Pam legislation. So, despite the fact that there's nothing much wrong with what is in the scheme, people have started protesting. There are many people who believe that this politics of polarization and hate during the current government's regime has damaged trust, which is one of the most important underlying drivers of economic development.
1657942842.0-1657958820.0
Is that also affecting employment? It may not be directly affecting employment, but it is indirectly, certainly impacting employment. How? I have often said that center is a fiction. The real action is in the states.
1657959670.0-1657981206.0
Until less we take states into confidence, action will not happen on the ground. And I said that as coal secretary, because we interacted with the states. Now, if you are at war with the states, how will things happen on the ground? There could be political difference of opinion, major political difference of opinion. But if there is a war, there's no dialogue, everything is misinterpreted, then we have trouble.
1657981318.0-1657996746.0
I will give you a sector which I am familiar with. Look at coal sector. Coal crisis keeps recurring and one of the reasons for recurrence is shortage in coal production. And why is that shortage in coal production? Because coal exists in states that are ruled by non India governments.
1657996778.0-1658019010.0
Look at West Bengal, Chattelgar, Purista, Jagan, Maharasht and a little bit in Madhya Pradesh. Now, if you are at war with those states, how do you get land for coal mining? I'm just giving one example. There could be many more examples where center and state, despite political difference, should work as partners. So, as you rightly said, this distrust is not otherwise.
1658019090.0-1658039086.0
Not only otherwise, but also between center and the state. So we should be working at Tandem, because if an industry has to be put up, there will be certain issues relating to central government. But most of the issues will relate to the state government. How about sitting across the table and becoming a principal facilitator? People asked me even as education secretary and post secretary what were you?
1658039108.0-1658061954.0
I said I was principal facilitator. I couldn't do much. I was enabling things to happen. I think both the government center and state should become facilitators to industry, small scale, medium scale. I can go into the details of how it can be done, because we did it when I was heading project monitoring group, what I was doing in cabinet city, facilitating, setting up of industry, and it happened in 15 months time.
1658061992.0-1658080330.0
There was clearance of more than five lack of road over the project during up a three, when all hell was ups, two, when all health was breaking loose. It can happen even now. I was very heartened. It was very heartening to learn that ministry of coal has set up that coal project monitoring portal again, that group to fast act projects. That's the way forward.
1658080400.0-1658114966.0
You know, dialogue is the way forward. And as you said, if there's distrust between segments of society, if there's distrust between sentence state, how will that dialogue happen? If that dialogue doesn't happen, manufacturing will not happen, services will not happen if manufacturing and services don't happen how will employment happen? So it may not directly impact employment but I think it is impacting employment. Nothing in the short term do you think that India urgently needs cash transfers or an employment guarantee scheme for the bottom 20% to help them consume and pay back debt or you think that's a bad idea?
1658115068.0-1658137194.0
No, they already see MNREGA. But apart from Mga, there is cash transfer happening. All this financial arrangement is a temporary arrangement. We don't look at fundamentals. I mean, since I handled the power sector and coal sector, when we wanted to revive the discounts, we provided this financial assistance, so to say.
1658137312.0-1658150494.0
Now, financial assistance can give you some time to sort out fundamental issues. But if fundamental issues are not sorted out, this problem will occur. So what is the fundamental issue? Generate employment in the interim? Yes.
1658150532.0-1658156942.0
If there is a crisis, government does it. Government does cash transfer. It was done. MNREG is there. The ambit would be increased.
1658157006.0-1658172770.0
But that's not a permanent solution. Permanent solution is getting the private sector and the public sector going to generate employment. Getting the manufacturer. You know the ideals of make in India needs to be worked out on the ground. I was going through the documents or document of Making India.
1658172850.0-1658184730.0
It talks about what, but doesn't go into details of why. And that's why it didn't happen. There was a lot of roaring, but I don't think the line traveled any distance. Yes, anecdotally? Yes.
1658184800.0-1658210466.0
You talk to anybody who handled MEK in India, he'll give examples of people who work. No, look at the macro picture and there hasn't been a third party evaluation. Why don't we do third party evaluation of loud announcements that are made just to understand, if things didn't go right, why didn't they go right and we can correct it? I keep giving everyone the example of GST. GST is a classic example of taking everyone on board.
1658210648.0-1658226402.0
Not being at board, you know, it was very tricky. It is only the sagacity of Arun Jatiy Jetty that GST happened. You imagine today, if GST were to happen, it wouldn't have happened at all. It won't happen because everyone is fighting with each other. So there could be a difference of opinion between various stakeholders.
1658226546.0-1658258580.0
But the beauty of democracy is you sit around a table, discuss and find solutions. Unfortunately, they're throwing stones at each other, literally and figuratively. Now, there are some questions from our listeners. So Saket wants to know the Ministry of labor scheme Atma Nirabhar Bharat Rajkar Yogana has been to incentivize the creation of new employment along with Social Security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during the COVID pandemic. How effective was it?
1658259350.0-1658275210.0
Frankly speaking, post retirement? I have not kept track of the scheme, so I'm not the right person to comment on that. I should know first the main features of the scheme and then understand its implementation. I'm sorry, I'm not conversant with the details of this. So I won't be able to answer then.
1658275280.0-1658298890.0
Joy Deep has asked how can the government attract more investments that also focus on employment generation? I have been talking for quite some time about this issue on promoting investment. Why and why does an investment happen? I always believe in looking at the why of it. In order to find the how of it.
1658299060.0-1658326010.0
Investment will happen if the investor feels first comfortable and second, he has some assurance of the return on investment. If those two things happen, then he will invest. And once investment happens, naturally employment will be generated. So instead of bothering directly about employment, let's try and facilitate implementation of projects through investment. And this can also be done again.
1658326080.0-1658351630.0
Having been in it for some time, I'm certain that it can be done again. How about engaging intensively with the investors and trying to understand why aren't they not investing? What does it take to make them invest instead of making announcements? You know, normally what happens is a big mail is organized now everyone signs MoU, photographs taken, next day headline and then no one talks about it there. No, it doesn't work that way.
1658351700.0-1658361618.0
I have nothing against it. Photo opportunity should be there, publicity should be there. But let's sit down with each one of them. And when I say each one of them, it's not merely big industries 5000 crore 10,000? No.
1658361784.0-1658394560.0
How about sitting with each smaller industry? Again this can be done because it has been done. You create an institution as we try to do in India banhu in Gulupi long back 95 when we probably were the biggest attractors of investors after Maharashtra and Gujarat why did it happen? Because the investors started feeling comfortable which years was that? This was way back in 95, 94, 95, when investment if you look at the investment, the IEMs during that time, you see up ranks at number three.
1658395090.0-1658429014.0
And it happened it happened here also. When we started doing that in the project monitoring group, it was perhaps for the first time that both the president CIA and President Fiki wrote to the prime minister stating that this is how industrialization should happen, referring to what was happening in the project monitoring group. I have those letters with me so instead of becoming friendly with few let's become friendly with everyone. Anyone who wants to do genuine investment to the a genuine person why not engage with them? Let them feel comfortable.
1658429142.0-1658459410.0
Comfortable not in front of powers that be really comfortable because no one will have the courage to say anything except one baja is here and a Baja there no one will speak up because they know what's going to be the consequence if they say anything negative. In fact they should be encouraged to come out with the problems with a view to finding a solution there's no criticism. If there is a problem so be it. Again, it would require a lot longer conversation. I am presently trying to help someone who's trying to digitize all the processes in the garment.
1658460230.0-1658497502.0
Imagine a scenario which I imagine I couldn't do when I was in service I tried to do a few things. Imagine if an industrialist doesn't have to go to any government office to get any clearance no physical I started this way back in certain areas it worked in certain areas. Now the effort is the common man should not go to any office for any work he go to a private or a public kiosk files his application, knows where his application is sitting you track the application and he gets his certificate or whatever he wants. Technology can do that. So I think we can become principal facilitators in the government.
1658497556.0-1658507170.0
We should become facilitators. And this can only happen because the industrialists or the investor knows where the shoe pinches. Sit with them. Sit with them. Not in a conference.
1658508070.0-1658533900.0
In conference no one will come out with ground reality. You sit with them in a smaller group try and understand their problem. I mean you can have your tamasha, you can have your photographs but unless you go intensively into the causes of the problem that it faces again as I keep saying I'm speaking from experience where it happened and it pains me to see that something that had happened why shouldn't it happen? Now.
1658536270.0-1658561454.0
Anil Saloop, in all the years that I've known you, you have been always been an optimist. But nevertheless, I will ask you this question india was supposed to benefit from its demographic from the demographic dividend. But with such a high rate of joblessness, are we going to lose out? See, as you rightly said, I was an optimist. I am an optimist.
1658561502.0-1658578866.0
I'll be an optimist. That's the only way to go forward. I still feel young in that sense that I see a bright future for this country. We haven't committed a number of mistakes but we have succeeded in a number of ways. And I'm sure that we are going to be benefited by this demographic dividend.
1658578978.0-1658601390.0
I'm certain that it won't be a demographic disaster. The only contention that I have now is let us accept where things are going wrong. Because if we don't do that, I mean, everything is not going wrong. There are lots of things that are happening which are very good but if we don't accept the fact of a few things going wrong, we'll never correct them. We'll keep them pushing them under the carpet or the line will keep roaring without traveling any distance.
1658602690.0-1658607020.0
Thank you so much, Anil. Always a pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much.

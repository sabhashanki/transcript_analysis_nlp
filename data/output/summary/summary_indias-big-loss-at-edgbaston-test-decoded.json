{"summary": "Cricket with ayas Maiman on Kulkay. We are discussing India's big loss at the India Bastin test. I've got with me senior journalist, sports journalist Vijay Lokapali England lost by 125 runs on the third day of the third Test against India. The hosts were bowled out for 400 in their first innings. India then went on to win the Test by an innings and 49 runs. India had everything going in its favor against England. They also had a new captain and a new coach. Everything suggested that this England team certainly can't beat this Indian team. I'm just wondering what would have been the state of Ravi Shastri was in charge when they lost in the WTC final to New Zealand. We lost two matches in South Africa and we've lost one against Rohit Sharma's 146 in that situation was a magnificent effort. Would you have honestly thought that India was going to lose this match on I don't know if any batsman in Indian cricket in the last decade has had so much time to play the ball. The ease with which he I would have gone for Isha Pun given the responsibility, if not this next season, you will find Rishabun leading the squad, right? Because there is no guarantee that KL Rahul will be there as captain Virat Kohli has been in tepid form for two and a half years. How much of a rope do you think the selectors are still going to give him? Virat Kohli has been terribly short of luck, there's no question about that. His reflexes are fine, his fitness is fine, he has the right temperament. The only thing is, like they say, either he gets an unplayable ball or he plays a Virat is somebody who thrived under pressure. The way he batted in South Africa in 2017, 1718, he was fresh as a captain. It's not Rabbit ASTRI says Virat Kohli is going through a phase in his cricket. The batsman has been fantastic in the nets Virat Kohli has become an enigma from a master batsman. The sooner he gets out of this enigma, I think Indian cricket starts z It pains me to see Ashwin sitting out. It really pains me because when he's at his best, he's watching the match, not playing in it. He could have definitely played here Last year, out of four Test matches, he played zero none. Virat was roundly and Ravi Shasti were roundly criticized for keeping out the champion bowler. So Rishabhan Jadeja is the man for the future as a wicketkeeper, as a batsman, and as possibly I would pick him as a captain. The way he plays, the fearless, intrepid kind Adam Gilchrist made his Test debut after seven, eight seasons of domestic cricket. He was 27, 28 when he first played for Australia. He never looked back for the next eight, nine years that he played for Mahendra Singh Dhoni is always smiling, says AMA. Dhoni was at a party and I was also at the party, but you know, briefly you could make out that he's full of beans Rishad upan is the leading light in that situation. He's the guy who's actually leading this in the vanguard of this bunch of players Shami should have had about 30, 40, 50 wickets more in Test matches. He's India's pace attack or a bunch of pace bowlers looks fantastic. But how to translate this potential match situation or winning situation into a victory England's approach of all out aggression like Joanne Croft cry Dutch team used to play total football. These guys are playing total cricket in England were being aggressive and India was being over aggressive. Avoiding the follow on and getting close to India's score was the reason why they remained in the match. One strong partnership can just cut the ground from under you and they I have no hesitation saying he's the world's best batsman by a mile. In the pecking order, I would actually put after Joe Root.

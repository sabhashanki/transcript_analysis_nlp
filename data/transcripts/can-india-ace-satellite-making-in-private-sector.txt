Hello and welcome to Kolke. Hulk is an Indian social media platform meant for having deep conversations.
1656705170.0-1656761060.0
Most social media platforms are either Chinese American or European in origin. But Kolk is Indian. The server and the data everything remains in India. We are in conversation on my show towards a New India which is also being labeled as Nayyador. In Nayador we are talking and taking you today to a journey into space to those stars and nebula and galaxy which we dream of and to take us into that realm of space we have with us.
1656761510.0-1656824360.0
Dr. M anothere is very favorably and lovingly called India's Moon Man and Mars Man and Sabriquay which he carries lightly on his shoulders. But he made India proud when he gave India first Chandrayan one, then gave India Mangalyan and was the key player till almost the very end in Chandrayaan two. Today's discussion is all about looking at the future. Can India a satellite making in the private sector, the Indian Space Agency Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the whole ecosystem is gearing up for bringing the private sector in a big way.
1656825210.0-1656861474.0
People hear so much about SpaceX. Can India get its own SpaceX soon? Some of the foundations for that were laid by none other than Dr. Anadray. While most of the credit for Chandrayan and Mangalyan goes to him, many may not know that getting the private sector into the clean room of the Indian Space Agency also the credit should go to him.
1656861672.0-1656892570.0
He was the former director of what is now the Ur Rao Satellite Center in Bangalore. Thanks a lot for joining us. Dr. Anadray, you are now part of an organization in Tamil Nadu which is also again helping with satellites and with technology for our audience. Can you first explain to us who makes India's satellites and rockets?
1656895010.0-1656939834.0
Yeah. I think, as you are told and many people knowing Indian Space Research Organization is the front runner to make the satellites and launch vehicles, launching them, operating them and giving applications and even the science missions like Chandraya and Mongolia on. And even the science to derive, I think, many things in the name of whatever comes to the name of space in India. I think it's ISRO. But in ISRO also we have a good number of scientists, technocrats, even administrative staffs part and personal of that and supporting them and supporting them.
1656939872.0-1657002906.0
A good number of Indian academia as well as Indian industries are part and parcel of this ongoing work. Especially if you look at here of late. I think the number of missions, what we make and the number of launches, what we make and our presence of Indian space program around the moon or Mars when you're talking about a fairly good number of Indian industries playing a reasonably good role is a part and parcel of the Indian space program. So Indian space program is all about ISRO taking the flag bearing but a good number of the supporting hats to start with, very modestly maybe to make the harnesses making and slowly coming for the small packages where everything is given just wiring and giving back. Then it came even the good number of packages and the sensors also being done by the industry on a turnkey basis.
1657003018.0-1657036250.0
And now slowly I think almost end to end. May not be just one industry, but be a consortium of industries and good number of industries putting together. I think already we have around 78 satellites rolling out of yes, we saw satellite center and the current year of satellite center going to the launch pad in the launchpad. Also you look at here the launch vehicle also good number of industries in terms of proponent making, stages making and hardness making avionics to come. I think we have a fairly good number of teams on that.
1657036320.0-1657104266.0
So that way but for the mission management, I think today Indian industry is capable of making end to end of the satellites as well as the launch of vehicles as sac currently. Before we go ahead, I must tell our viewers and congratulations to the team at ISRO for a very successful mission of the Polar Satellite launch vehicle. Less than 24 hours ago, three Singaporean satellites have been placed in orbit and this is a fascinating mission. The fourth component is what is very interesting in that and I think we can leave the discussion of what is going to be the poem which will be written by the fourth stage for a later discussion. But PSLV mission yesterday and before that within the week, the launch of a communication satellite from Aryan space in Kuru.
1657104378.0-1657128022.0
Again. A commercial mission done by the Indian Space Research Organization. This makes the state for a readiness like Dr. Anandari says, for the Indian industry to get on further. There is some kind of an echo coming doctor, I have lost you Dr.
1657128076.0-1657173350.0
Anotheri yeah, while we wait for Dr. Anandra to come, let me explain to you what happened yesterday. The Polar Satellite launch vehicle which lifted off from Shiharikota carried three commercial satellites from Singapore and then it placed them in the precise orbit. It also has an experimental fourth stage which will perform several experiments. And before that, a communication satellite which had been totally leased by Tatas was also launched by the Indian Space Research Organization.
1657173770.0-1657203710.0
Things are gearing up for better times at the Indian Space Research Organization. Dr. Anadre, you said many of the private sector get involved in space, even in satellite making and in rocketry. Currently what how do they get involved? Are they vendors and do we want to making full stages and finally full satellites and rockets?
1657205830.0-1657261470.0
Yeah, I think to start with the handholding, they got trained and become the vendors. And now you look at here to start with our IRS satellites making integration, assembly, integration and testing. Also private consortium of private industries and that subsequently we have taken to another three group of industries for the satellite assembly integration testing whereas the packages harness and many things already started coming from the Indian industries now putting the things together, making a real satellite and testing it in a simulated thermo and vibration environment. Also now being conducted by the Consortium Industries. And that also we have a group of one public sector industry.
1657261550.0-1657309790.0
Another one is full fledged large scale industry. And another one is coming from Alpha Technology. The same team along with another four or five of medium scale and small scale industries are consortium like that we have and similarly now of Plate. I think very recently the contract also has been signed with the identified with the industry to make the by PSLV to make its concern. So that way while doing all these things enough handholding has been done technically for the manpower and whatever the infrastructure built by ISRO for various way that Rancho vehicle or the satellite that big ecosystem is made available to the industry industries.
1657309870.0-1657360674.0
So that way you look at here there is a fairly good number of ecosystem in terms of the technical manpower ready to make the satellites a launch vehicle and trying to use already built in extra capacities in terms of the ISRO facilities concern. So that way I think today we can say with still under the supervision of Eagle eyes of ISRO especially the reliability and quality assurance teams are looking over the soldiers of the private industries this will happen there. So basically this is trying to bring in our industries to the level of the space. Space is not only the height, space is all about reliability, quality and the overall the system engineering. Very many vessels are there with respect to that.
1657360712.0-1657394234.0
So that way our industries also gets graduated while working for the space industry in terms of the launch vehicle and satellites, that consent because nothing called calling back for the satellite automobile you can do in a laptop, you can do in a smartphone. Something is happening on an iPhone used to call back, but such a thing is not possible. So it calls for a totally different level of reliability and assurance. So towards that, I think whatever the build up within Israel and that help is with them. So with that, I think it's going gradually.
1657394282.0-1657448560.0
I think they also will get graduated towards that line is concerned. See, Prime Minister Modi started speaking about opening up or unlocking the space sector about two years ago. And recently we saw the inauguration of a large facility in Amdabhar. But for our audience, I must prime them, saying that well before Prime Minister Modi said bring private sector in, the Ur Rao Satellite Center, which was under a different name at that point, had already brought private sector in. Can you tell me a little bit about how you got private sector to come and integrate satellites especially the Navik series which was a really big quantum jump from everything in house.
1657450450.0-1657517166.0
Yeah, I think you look at that. I think we made a very calculated effort, multipronged approach to bring the so called the satellites also beyond the class ceiling, one side bringing academia to make the small student satellites so that they get along with us. And another thing, trying to get the industry partners they can do is to start with a small level breaking the harnesses, then the small packages later even handing it over, the full system package is being done by them. Everything we have done that in the process of time. We built a huge facility nearly 150 acres beyond Distros at Westwood Distro, Saturday Center, indigested, the outskirts of Bangalore, wherein everything under one from the printed circuit boards, making two fully assembled satellite, fully tested and packed, ready to go to either variant space or Sergio Record or that big facility we have made under one combo.
1657517278.0-1657569058.0
So now this can this has the capacity of semi assembly integration and testing of 20 satellites, the 20 satellites of the state of the satellites of reasonably good sizes. And having done that, but Israel's manpower itself is not good enough to simultaneously do that. So we brought in concept where in the consortium industry, if they're ready to do and come and work with the ISRO, ISRO can ready to give a training by making one or two satellites with their manpower being trained under the supervision of ISRO. Then if we have seen by the team they are ready to make the Saplays, handing over the Sapling st to them. So with that mode, I think a good number of industries came forward with the way it's normal government procedure.
1657569154.0-1657643082.0
Finally, a consortium of industry, five industry together consortium was selected with the normal Karma Coleman procedure and they have been trained actually, I really thrilled to see a good number of IAT and also part of that team, around 70 member team was there and a good number of youngsters, and they got trained with the one satellite. Then I think they have taken for the fully assembled testing and integrating and moving to the launch per dispenser. So that continued and subsequently whatever the lessons learned with that, now we expanded the version wherein we are trying to bring in a competitiveness among the industries also. So that's why next time we brought in another mode level, where in three group of industries, so one public sector industry, part of the electronics, another one is large scale industries under the Tatas group, and another one is a consortium of the medium scale industry and small industries, Alpha Design Technologies and the other partners putting together. So these three teams were given one on satellites to make and whomever makes first, they will get an opportunity to make one more.
1657643136.0-1657678066.0
I think that very, very competitive gender. I think that also went reasonably well, I think to that date. I think nine satellites were assembled by these three teams concerned. So that means using the facilities of ISRO and whatever the packages are coming from ISRO centers and as well as from the private centers, they're able to that means now they are ready. They know how the individual packages comes and how the individual package is tested and how their readiness to fit into a launch vehicle or the satellite is ready and how they are tested.
1657678098.0-1657703470.0
They are integrated, tested and rolled out the satellites to the launch pad. So you can look at here end to end ecosystem of the facilities available, infrastructure available and the manpower is available and the technical know how is available. I think today not by one industry. You have group of industries simultaneously. They are ready and competitiveness also brought in with them.
1657703540.0-1657750670.0
I think that way we have a reasonably good tradeo system today, which can take even some of them already. I know that some of these industries already got some of the offers from outside India. Also seeing the success from what is happening there and seeing the overall cost effectiveness of the making this athletes and these industries are part and parcel of that cost effectiveness and reliable systems coming together, putting all the things together. I think there is a reasonably good green signals to showcase even beyond from Indian borders. There is a good number of Indian other countries coming forward and towards that also.
1657750740.0-1657784490.0
When I was there, I made another program wherein drinking every year around 30 countries who are not part and personal of the space programs in their country today from UN and giving their training to them. It is not really a training. It is more like in a way I can tell you, it's more like what showcase, what space can do. And India has developed that much in the developing India and the developed India space made a reasonably good contribution towards that. If that's happening for India, then why not you?
1657784560.0-1657825334.0
So, what happened for India nearly 60 years back when we went to NASA or France or Russia? I think India is playing that role 60 years into that program today. So like that, nearly near 45 countries have got what Charlie is and how the satellite is being made there and how India is capable of doing that, putting together, going back. I think now they are already they're trying to see why can't their countries be part and part of this space program that comes. I think these industries which are part and first of all of this initial efforts, I think they are going to gain the fruits of such things.
1657825372.0-1657854266.0
Also. That way you look at here, I feel a holistic ecosystem. It is not only infrastructure, it is not only our technical manpower. The possibility of people coming towards Indian continent to make the satellites for them and launch for them and use for them. I think that's also given that I think that way you look at here and that too the post COVID when the world is looking beyond China, I think India is going to get target.
1657854378.0-1657857630.0
I think that is the thing in space that is concerned.
1657859990.0-1657903520.0
Now the world will be coming to India and you took India all the way to Moon and Mars. We will end the conversation by talking about your mission to the Moon which is a favorite between the two of us. But before we go there, in yesterday's Polar Satellite launch vehicle for the first time two payloads from startups Rua and Digandra have gone into space. Are you excited about the startup ecosystem which is kind of just about revving up?
1657905650.0-1657950366.0
Yeah, it's definitely because this is what I told that we did dynamism and competitiveness to make sure that what we are doing is live and what swing is its meaning. So it's relevant tomorrow's. It is relevant only even if today we are competitive and dynamic enough to have we enthusiast the teams and to come out with a very very innovative way and that way I think this is also a reasonably good attempt. That means a fourth stage which any of it is being in orbit and instead of simply passively allowing it to die down and making use that thing also that means until last drop you take the juice out of that. I think that is the thing.
1657950388.0-1657988138.0
If you do, we are already more economical. Our PSLV is very very economical and compared to the launch vehicle and beyond that it's four stage also going to lose for the couple of weeks or months together and that goes for the startups to do have very very cost effective the space environment to be tested. I think that's very good effort that way. It's really good to both the startups who are thinking as chairman told, it's a very short time. I think they have been asked and they came very very good way.
1657988224.0-1658023062.0
And yes, that we have to wait for the poem because I think it's let the Chairman come out with that what is being there, we were sitting there but I think it's really I. Think that poem will be initiated way beyond the chairman. Let's leave the teaser out there. Those are fascinating things in the audience. People are also asking about the 75 satellite Azadi mission and you are part of that in a way like a mentor and advisor to the students who are doing that.
1658023196.0-1658048302.0
Can you tell me a little bit about the Azadi Sat mission? And also will that also help in getting better manpower for space because you will need a lot of human capital. Exactly, yeah, exactly. I think what we rightly told this also again a multipronged approach. One is take the people to the thinking level.
1658048356.0-1658077094.0
It's a much better way. That is why when India is celebrating 75th India's independence, I think 75 student satellites 75 satellites done by the Indian students going to the space. It will be a rear mark to showcase how India has progressed during its independent India and how India is ready to take the next generation to the upcoming space. I think that is one way. Another way is rightly told.
1658077132.0-1658120340.0
I think in the process a good team building across the Indian educational institutions and as well as the team ready to take forward. Because especially when India is emerging as giving you the space industry coming into the private side, you need a fairly good number of young talents with very, very innovative ideas. So that way putting together, I think able to bring early stage itself the people to make the satellites, operate the satellites we think themselves cooperate and collaborate things at all. If you go, I think that makes a reasonably good thing. And this has been very well acknowledged by Prime Minister of India when he talked about this.
1658120950.0-1658158734.0
Not a very small place in his latest UN assembly speech itself, he made very good remarks. When India develops, I think when India move forward, India will take others out. So that means India is celebrating its 75 of India's independence. You know that every independence day on VVIP comes from outside India. But now the 75 student Circulates goes out that will definitely will talk volumes about what as I told you, what India has moved forward in the last 60 years in the space program and how India is ready to go forward with the younger generation.
1658158782.0-1658178870.0
I think it's really a milestone event. And towards that I think already we have taken a good tour this initiative also it's not taken just for spur of the moment. And we have talked about somewhere in 20, 15, 16 time frame itself when the 75th year comes. Well, the survey do. And towards that also already you have some babies that have been done.
1658179020.0-1658199134.0
You know that here a year back we have launched three satellites called Unity SAP. Okay? One college from Tamil Nadu, another one from Pune. I've got two doubled colleges and one another one from Bagarostra. These three institutions made three different satellites and that they also launched them.
1658199172.0-1658227906.0
And similarly some more things also AI keep coming there. So that means we have already what type of the satellites you have to launch is clear. But now bringing the Indian institutions already more than 125 institutions are in the line that competing. The best of tops at 125 will be asked to play during these 70. India city funders here under that every one of the institutions will be having its own ground station.
1658228018.0-1658272882.0
So that for example, Karnataka is going to have three satellites. And that is the government school students will part and parcel of that making. So that we look at here from school student to the university students, a spectrum of people going to work for this to make the 70 pay Saplates launch and do that, I think it's really a remarkable thing. And that way making ready for the next level of the students for their higher studies, when you go for the space and the people who are in engineering colleges, they are ready to come to the industry. So that way I think it's a good activity going on while everything is going on that we are not just leaving.
1658272946.0-1658297130.0
As I told here, when the Indian industry is working, ISRO's quality assurance team will be backing for them. Similarly, a good number of ISRO engineers who are retired scientists retired and they are still already enthusiasts to work with them. So their wisdom also will be there. The tinyism of science stars also will be there. So when we make 75 students athletes, it is the students and teachers.
1658297210.0-1658317154.0
And the teachers are most of them like me, some elderly people working with the younger generation. I think that wisdom also going off because that is what really required. Because some hand holding is required and nurturing is required. Some tutoring is required, mentoring is required. And this space program is all about that.
1658317192.0-1658335050.0
I think that is also they will be getting a feel about this while making this. So that way I think 75 student satellite program also is another mission. Chandrayaan mission. Mangal I think 75 also. I feel it will be really a good mission Indians to celebrate.
1658336590.0-1658380562.0
You are still a very young man at heart and you keep giving India more and more things to celebrate. Let's not dwell a little bit. Go back in time. I hope you're also teaching the youngsters that you need to burn the midnight oil to succeed. Because I remember during Chandrayaan One you burned the midnight oil for months together because you are working on India time and you working on Europe time and you working on American time and all of this to try and make India succeed.
1658380626.0-1658409810.0
And you took India and the maiden attempt to the orbit of Moon. And then on the maiden attempt you took India to the orbit of Mars. I'm sure there are not many people in the world who can claim to have done that. I hope you're teaching that also to your youngsters who are participating alongside. How was your experience with Chandrayan One and a little bit about mangalyan.
1658412230.0-1658426642.0
Yeah. Yes. Palo because he told the failure is not. I think that is what we share. So when that being the case, when that being the case, even though it's made an attempt has to be succeeded.
1658426706.0-1658442570.0
Okay? And that too when we are making a mission which is the 17th mission go to the moon when our Chandrajan started. So it should not be also ranked also. Even if it succeeds, it's not be also rank. That means we should make a mark on our 17th mission also.
1658442640.0-1658485674.0
So this is a really tall order of requirement within ourselves we put. But even though we put all these things attack that means what is the budget available was reasonable, not very big budget. We look at your launch vehicle also very modest launch vehicle putting the things together we put a target of going to the moon, not just be alone and we brought in a good number of other internationally recruited laboratories like NASA, Isa, Jackson, Bulgarian space Agency like that we all brought together. So when we brought together that this gives another dimension. It is not only our team has to work together, our team has to work with others also.
1658485792.0-1658548654.0
Under there, as I told from west coast of UAS east coast of UES UK, France, Bulgaria, Sweden jackson, Japan that way I look at here again indian time is giving them in the middle. So my morning has to start at definitely early in 05:00 and it has to go late beyond midnight. Then only I will be working with their office time and I think it's that way when that happens, it is not only projected works, definitely the team also supports and believe me though you are talking about Kulkay today we are talking about, believe me, in 2004 to 2008 also we had something similar within ourselves. So that's why we could connect across the globe and so that we could make the mission within the four years and we could succeed that mission within the four years. Not only that, the team as a team Chandraya made a remarkable discovery which none of the individual organization put together they could make it so that way we can showcase the world.
1658548772.0-1658573954.0
Yes, a team, a common wisdom can provide. And even though the moon has been rediscovered once again but the discovery of water on the moon is the unique, unique thing. What Chandrayaan has done and falling behind, that definitely the lessons learned from Chandrayan definitely we carried forward to the mission Mangal. And there, of course, we alone went there to showcase. Because before that also very many missions.
1658574002.0-1658606690.0
Nearly 50 on missions have gone but not more than 20 unsucceed. That meant 30 missions paid out of that not even a single country could succeed in the first attempt. It was fifth attempt for us, 9th attempt for Russia and that time there was no success for China and Japan. But when we made I think we made very very unambiguous success when our prime minister of India was standing behind us and there was a really unique mission. And when we did this, believe me, the budget approval to the launch just 14 months.
1658606840.0-1658675430.0
I think nobody in the world would have made this thing that mean within that short time period government approval to the prime minister of India coming and congratulating just 14 months away. Mission Mangal mission Mangal so that's really a good thing we have done and that made the whole space faring nations look at India. And as I would have told somewhere else nominally some of the school children being taken in the name of educational to the NASA many places happening there. But believe me, five top level scientists, technocrates under the leadership of the deputy administrator of NASA they themselves were here staying two days in Israel cyclist center to see how this flows repeatedly could succeed this and what is happening there. And they're talking about money is less and time is less, but still the succeed what is happening there.
1658675500.0-1658704670.0
They want to know what is infrastructure within ourselves. So just you can think about what is the remarkable changes these two missions have made. And beyond that, after 2008 you look at here, the number of commercial launches India has made also dropped fairly. So the brand this row also has come up in a very big way. So that way these two missions of Chandarayan Mangalyan made a remarkable, remarkable change in the Indian space programming.
1658705810.0-1658725286.0
And towards that definitely we feel whatever to the midnight high, whatever you burn is really worth. We have done it. I think you know that it's a it's a game, it's a part of the game, but definitely it's worth. Whatever we spent that time is making us still young. Okay, 24 hours.
1658725388.0-1658757870.0
Instead of spending only 8 hours, you are spending for 16 to 18 hours. It makes you really young for the next day. Not just brand ISRO. I think both Chandrayan and Mangalyan brought brand India into the forefront of the world. And that is why today we are seeing a new and a big push towards getting a bigger part of the commercial space sector.
1658758690.0-1658785834.0
Do you think, Dr. Anatre, in times to come we are already towards the Amrit Kal or the next 25 years, towards the century of India's independence. Will we be able to get a larger share of the commercial space market? The startups would certainly want it because startups are all about getting return on investments. Do you really think they are capable of doing that?
1658785872.0-1658818370.0
And will India be in a position to support them? I think it is because what all we talked about now is all the activities, whatever they have done is towards that target. That's what is concerned. But now actually though I'm talking about sound TV missions, other thing as a part of Samarado State Council science and technology, I am trying to make the plus a reputation launch phase. It's a totally, totally different basket such that one side, yes, it will do a cost effective launch phase from closer.
1658818730.0-1658870106.0
But the lessons learned from Sergey Kota instead of bringing many systems from across India and with all its logistic issues something like that, if you are able to make in underputting that for 50 km really indoor space park and such that everything. As I told here we have done today center, today URC printers that could put two fully assembled Saturday rolling it up now I want to see to that. The plushagar patinum is ready to take again from the component. To printer circuit port to fully assembled satellite tested satellite and all the stages are done and waiting for ready to launch. That means on demand.
1658870238.0-1658891526.0
Within 24 hours you must be able to have pick a satellite put on a launch vehicle and launch there. I think that target is not beyond our reach that we do. All these startups definitely will make use of that very effectively. So that means we have the requirement we look at here. Elon Musk.
1658891558.0-1658903354.0
Number of satellites. What to technically huge. That is only one agency. But a competitor even you take our own aircraft is good number of hundreds of satellites are going to launch. But today is a Falcon launch.
1658903402.0-1658940794.0
Of the phase. Six heavy lifts and all okay for the first set of Constellation to make after Constellation has been done, I expect once we have few thousands of satellites in the Constellation lower CarBit, something or other failing. In a week. Or that means within a week, you must be able to replace that and put the things done there. And when such a requirement is there, I think the coolest Saga Platinum with our small satellite launch vehicle with our startups are ready to make this cost of it to small satellites together this combination will be unparalleled competitor to anybody in the world.

So that way I feel there is an ecosystem emerging. That ecosystem is properly tuned bring the startups together and make these requirements being made that means on demand satellites strategically also something more will come all put together. I think a huge number of satellite launches very frequently to come and towards. That I think when you bring in the polyesterapatinum as not a point. When we do, definitely not very far.

Just four years from now we can see a CSAW change in our system. So 25 years from now, I think what we going to see is going to be a remarkable, remarkable thing. The startups already could have become unicorns. By the time that is a very lovely point to end our conversation together. I Think.

I think you called me. And congratulator day starts from that. Yes. But let me say not just taking India to the orbit of Moon and Mars and rewriting the history of the moon, which was considered parsed to finding water molecules on the moon. Dr anadray has done remarkable achievements for the country and to now see him taking India to the next level or the next.

Orbit altogether. New orbit where commercial launches become successful, where launch on demand becomes a part of the Indian space ecosystem is all within reach for all the young people on the show. And we will hear some of this. This should be music to your ears. The Indian space ecosystem is really ready to reach for the stars.

And the audience and people is what we live and die for. End of the day, it is the Indian public which has to be happy about what is happening around us. So this conversation of an Atmirbar India in space happening on an Atmirbar platform is something we should be very proud about. So people who are listening in later read download Kulke and there will be many more conversations on Kolk about stuff which is used to us in everyday lives. Science and technology touches our lives almost every day in every form.

Whenever you go to the ATM machine to withdraw your cash, remember Dr. Anadura is watching you. All the transactions happen through satellite communication. So that is the presence of satellites in our daily lives. Thanks a lot for joining us and what a great audience and what a wonderful conversation.

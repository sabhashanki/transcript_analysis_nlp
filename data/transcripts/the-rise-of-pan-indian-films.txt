1656003930.0-1656030102.0
So today we are going to be talking about the rise of Pan Indian films. And we have with us Avinash from Cinema Express, the New Indian Express and Sandalya, the host of Podcast, Chitra Lochana. Hello everybody. And I'm excited for this conversation. So let's start by talking about your favorite recent pan Indian food.
1656030236.0-1656039320.0
Like whichever has released so far in the last two years. How about, Sandalya, we start with you. Yeah, sure.
1656041770.0-1656044200.0
I am a big fucker for a big.
1656047610.0-1656053980.0
Okay. Is my voice very low? No, your voice is fine.
1656056190.0-1656059470.0
Avenash was putting himself on mute so that there's no distance.
1656064210.0-1656077646.0
All of these paninian movies came out. From. The luclian but the one thing that hit out of the park for me was Arada. Definitely. Because for the first time in my.
1656077668.0-1656078240.0
Life.
1656087610.0-1656089480.0
Avi, what about you?
1656097630.0-1656136840.0
Okay, so probably my recent favorite panel film would be PG if just for the kind of responses I saw screen in Chennai at 04:00 A.m. In the morning. That euphoria something was deserved for very few actors in Tamar cinema. To see that being extended to the world of KGF and Prashant and everybody else wanted to I think that was a huge watershed moment for Panama films also of course I loved the response but then I saw Tamil version of KTF and four year that the film had, that was a bigger thing.
1656139050.0-1656157614.0
Okay, so when it comes to panendan films recently there's been an increase in the usage itself. Every second film is now being termed as Pan Indian by the filmmakers themselves. So what do you think about the rice in such a thing? Is it a marketing gimmick? What is your opinion this time?
1656157652.0-1656182598.0
Let me start with a week. Okay. Yeah, the Pan Indian tag is more or less marketing gimmick for most films, to be honest. Because the thing is do people watch a film in the original language or the dubbed versions is a huge question altogether. Not every film that is being tagged Pan Indian is being watched in the different language dubbed in.
1656182684.0-1656230854.0
For instance, I'm not giving examples the name of the films but then you have films that say Hindi, Tamar, Telugu, Maliala, Kanda but then people still watch the film in their original language. Anyway, many many films do not really warrant that tag. I think it's more to do with the let's jump on the panindale bandwagon and make Haywire sunshine kind of a thing. Because not every story deserves to be told in different languages. It can still be a rotate film which is seen in that particularly becoming detrimental to the film are slow starting to see this label itself as not a very positive thing.
1656230892.0-1656254782.0
So I think it's overkill to be honest. Okay, before I continue with Sandalya, there are certain inputs from the audience. So first they want the panelists to be louder. So Avinash and Sandalya, if you can speak a little louder and second, I think santillia, the light hitting on your face. Could you please rearrange your frame maybe a little?
1656254916.0-1656256160.0
Yeah, okay.
1656259730.0-1656273730.0
I think this should be better. Yes, this is better once you can set up. Okay. I hope this is better for the audience. Yes, it is better.
1656273880.0-1656282418.0
Okay. So Sandal, what do you think? Do you agree with Avinash? Like, what is your opinion? Yeah, actually I agree everything.
1656282504.0-1656299782.0
Whatever he said initially, it used to be a niche. Now it has sort of become like. Everyone wants to jump on that. Adding to that so there is a reason for him in Telugu that released. So that was initially made only for Telugu.
1656299926.0-1656318518.0
But at the end the producers decided. Introduction to Famil and Malialam because they saw market for Nurse in Samil and Malialam. And I saw some tweets from Kannada. Folks saying that why isn't it being released in Canada? Language folks needs to understand that Dabing.
1656318554.0-1656336066.0
Also takes a cost for the producing companies. And also distributors should be ready to. Take the fully with their language. So since they saw market for Nazia. In Malayalama, that is the reason why they wanted to dub that fully.
1656336098.0-1656378900.0
Otherwise there is no reason there is no reason for people to call anti Sundarani. Okay. So speaking of anti Sundaraniki, I have to think like when we had a discussion with Nani, he had said that Pan Indian is not a tag that producers or filmmakers should give themselves. It's a tag that the people have to give if they enjoy across the country. So do you think movies should go in that direction now instead of making Panander the term a joke, should they reconsider releasing firms in all languages just because they see other firms like R becoming success?
1656382970.0-1656398122.0
Let's take this first. I think it's being seen as a more of a prestige issue for many producers and actors. Like my film is being released in so many countries. Released in so many languages. That has become more of a prestige issue.
1656398256.0-1656417518.0
Because they're like, if that particular actor's film is doing this, why not my film also? But the point is just making dubbing film in different language is not enough. You need to go and promote it across these states in this country. That is what we look at the success of any panel we've seen so far. It's also due to the promotions they did.
1656417604.0-1656438422.0
It's not as if we just dub it and say this film is releasing here. Even the big stars films across country, they need to go out until my film is releasing right now. In your language, that should happen. It's not enough if you just release and just say this is a paranormal film. I think that is where the focus should be on rather than just pushing films across.
1656438476.0-1656466302.0
Because as we were saying, slowly it will turn into just another label and not have the significance that it should have. I think that's what is a major issue with these releases is happening right now. Okay? Santalya, do you see certain films, like you said, anti Sundaraniki? Do you see Telugu filmmakers take maybe a chance with the kind of films that they want to make?
1656466356.0-1656479540.0
Pandyan like Tani made a stand that he does not want to dub it in Canada. He didn't see a reason there. Do you see other filmmakers doing the same thing? How is the trend like in telgu film industry? Right?
1656481350.0-1656502554.0
I just want to come back on. Avina's point in relation to telu film industry only. While he said that marketing needs to be done, something very unique happened for Pushpa, which is marketing in Bollywood did not happen at all. There was zero marketing because the director itself was in the recording studio. He did not attend the prerelease event.
1656502672.0-1656524594.0
He was trying to finish off the post production works. But it made wonders in Bollywood after it released. Since RR was postponed, it ran for three weeks. But eventually it got released on Opt and then also it was a rage. We don't see Kohli doing a cinematic style on a cricket field.
1656524632.0-1656536760.0
Right? So Kupa was a rage without any marketing. And the same thing again happened with. Bulbulaya Two in Hollywood. There was no marketing as such, but the movie picked up and it is still running.
1656539930.0-1656541640.0
So if you see right.
1656543930.0-1656555718.0
One of the filmmakers said that the more rooted the stories are, the more. Global the stories become. So Pushpai is one such story. It is located in a small town, but it is made on a bigger. Scale that we already see.
1656555824.0-1656557760.0
But it is a very rooted story.
1656560930.0-1656568710.0
Whatever I see. Right. So there is a flurry of new. Edge filmmakers that are coming thanks to. Bawali Pole, Baw Valley.
1656568730.0-1656587462.0
We have seen new n number of. Filmmakers that are coming and all of. Them are not targeting Pan Indian. But the bigger the star is, the stakes are going bigger. And eventually I think only Maijabu has.
1656587516.0-1656603594.0
Taken a stand saying that he won't make direct indications. But since he is making a movie with Rajamoli, I think definitely it will be dubbed to other languages. Also. I see the trend as the biggest start. Eventually the movies will get dubbed because.
1656603632.0-1656630950.0
As Avina said, it has sort of. Become a stated here interesting. So let me get this question from the audience which I find very interesting. It's about how a filmmaker should like how would a filmmaker make this decision that this film will only work in this language or this film won't work in this language? What do you think the filters should be like as audiences.
1656637050.0-1656638040.0
To be honest?
1656641210.0-1656709618.0
So you can't really pinpoint and say this is the right mantra. Because as Sandley was saying, what happened with Pushpa or was people these paid doesn't mean everything can be put other things. It's very important to know what to managers and writers and go up. I'll give an example of what Mr. Kokrishnagar has told me director of Victim he was talking about how who this is what is banned Indian.
1656709814.0-1656732478.0
Is it a film that is let's say a Tamil film has been remad in multiple languages which means it has a market across languages. Does that make it Bannered? Or is a film which is just dubbed and reexpanded? So we are still grappling with the concept of what is bannered in itself. So initially we'll have a lot of trial other films that happens you'll have every second actor, every second film being apparent in film.
1656732574.0-1656756220.0
After a point you'll understand. They also understand that not every film can mounted that way. There will be a platter, there will be a saturation then you will find more clarity coming on this. Till then, probably a year or two or even faster if it comes to because of the advent of OTT there will be a clarity where people will understand that. Till then you would see every third film releasing across language being pushed as panic, right?
1656758590.0-1656759740.0
Yeah, I agree.
1656763010.0-1656776690.0
There is OTT and then there is also language. There is AHA in Telu which only cater to Telu. So there what we see is AHA takes the rights of Malayalam films and database.
1656780070.0-1656796874.0
So, as Avina's pointed out, I don't really understand how we bracket Pan Indian films. It is very difficult and the makers also need to decide if they want. To do it or not. So let's take the example of Major, right? So Major took the edition of going.
1656796912.0-1656817120.0
Pan Indian way back in 2019 before all of these leads and it is a small film in terms of budget. It is around 30 35 post, not. 102 hundred post but Adebushes decided to make it or they actually saw panel. In Telu and India because.
1656820770.0-1656831220.0
Speaking practical. Terms, they basically saw market for that story in India as well. And they had the confidence that the. Product will be very simple.
1656833450.0-1656848410.0
Even though the budget was small. They decided to make it in two languages. So we actually really can't I can. Put it in the box saying this is banning in or this is not. Because people after Kotiti people have started.
1656848480.0-1656857740.0
Watching Assambuslims as well. Even I watched a couple of Assammas. Which are very good. Before that we wouldn't dream of watching. An Assam with the.
1656860770.0-1656887218.0
That works for me. It works for me and it is. On the directors as having us pointed out the directors to directors and the producers decide what they actually want to take. Speaking of OTT like we have always had Pan Indian friends right from the 80s we have had since released either dubbed in India or directly made parallel in Indian Tamil. But recently the term panIndian has become very popular.
1656887394.0-1656904650.0
Do you think that people have got used to content from the south through OTT? So that opening up of market. Do you think it helped? Or what do you think would be the reason for this sudden rise in that pan and being termed.
1656910690.0-1656922318.0
For me, let's say if you are talking about. Telugu and family industry all of being. Short is the same language. Or the different language will always happen, right? From NTR and Shivaji Gani.
1656922494.0-1656936886.0
So Mr. Mah, which was short in. Telugu was badly short to Shivaji Garif. And the heroine was same across both the languages for Telu and Tamil. Because the industry was based out of.
1656936908.0-1656939320.0
Mudraj, Zen and Chennai. Now.
1656941550.0-1656963534.0
This interaction between both of these languages was always there. But the case study, the one I. Think that broke and please correct me if I'm wrong was Maha Chandra who took it to Bollywood as well. He made films in telu. He made films in Kamil and he made Philips in Hindi as well.
1656963652.0-1656980646.0
And Kamalasan was the star then. He's the star novel though because Vikram. Is raging and he took it across all the languages, right? But someone like a Shiranji V who. Was a contemporary person then he did.
1656980668.0-1656993926.0
A couple of movies, I think in Hindi but was not able to succeed there. And someone like an AMSA Bhachan there. Did not come here. I think then Mahal Chandar and Tamarajan. Are a unique case study.
1656994028.0-1657004850.0
But Selgu and Samil language were always. Dubbed here and there. The music was also like that, right? So Lehrajas and Air Ramban's music was. Always popular in telu industry.
1657004950.0-1657015360.0
There is a huge fan following for both of them in Zinc book because most of them music was remastered on merit. Okay?
1657017670.0-1657037106.0
Opening up the satellite satellite itself was a major push, you know. Because as we were just talking about, you know how seventy s, eighty s you had Hindi films happening, right? Rajani Khan being part of so many Hindi films everything is there. And Kamalas was doing it. NA Rajuna did a few films.
1657037138.0-1657051654.0
So nothing happened. The thing was so it's always as if there was an aspirational quality to do a Hindi film. It's always like, okay, a South Indian actor is doing a Hindi film. The market was bigger. Now what happened is the market for every language it comes bigger.
1657051782.0-1657072318.0
So it's not just Hindi cinema. The call for every language cinema to be part of the Indian cinema is happening only because each of these languages have developed the market. That's why the pan Indian term is being specifically used. Because Tamil films or a Telugu film or a Karnatak film is being accepted as a Hindi film. Also.
1657072484.0-1657084110.0
The Hindi films are already being accepted in the other states. So those films are always considered pan. Indeed. It's just now that the reverse thing is happening. It's a labeling of these things before just Hindi films being accepted everywhere.
1657084190.0-1657107774.0
But since the Tamil or Telugu film is being accepted there they need to put a tag to it. Otherwise, we've always been seeing let's say one of the films films like you've seen roja being there, Bombay there. The thing was and I've heard stories of how K Vishnacha's films used to run in Telugu in different states for weeks together. So those were also panic in films. Just that.
1657107812.0-1657131134.0
Because the acceptance of the so called regional cinema is now being accepted. Also because Bollywood has been having a lull for a long time now. They're not the big stars haven't come out with releases and can see the amount of everyone start for entertainment. Everyone wants to go what's in and out. The only industries that is continuously churning out with big name is the south ending film industry.
1657131262.0-1657153834.0
That is why the label happens. Because you want to give them a tag and not just say the business opening up, you just need to tag them. Otherwise there's no Band india per se. All films have been using across borders for years together, decades together. Now, since the reverse movement is happening, the labeling has started.
1657154032.0-1657171186.0
But I see it as that has always been there. Now, Akama Hasani film, he needs to come up film which will be accepted in the Hindi audience. That that difference has happened right now. It happened with Shankar's engine with 2.0. That is the starting point of everyone knows everybody else.
1657171288.0-1657188934.0
It's not like earlier, you couldn't just get away with new actor in the 90s or 2000s in Bollywood. You would still know of them. They wouldn't know of a new 98s actor in summer cinema, teleco Cinema. Now that's not the case. Yeah, who's just had ten years of experience is a known name.
1657189052.0-1657206880.0
His bigger name. It's been compared to his volume, compared to its volumes. I mean, that reverse thing is what is now starting off the labels. Otherwise, Indian cinema has always been Indian cinema. The whole differences, taxes on their part, I think it's more of a label issue.
1657207810.0-1657227554.0
Okay, speaking of like, we have spoken about marketing films. We have spoken about the kind of films that need to be labeled Pan Indian. So one of the films that is upcoming for a release is Ramastra with Ranbir Kapoor and Aliya Bhatta has a Pan India star cast. Like it has Nagarjuna. Right?
1657227752.0-1657257226.0
Covering the telhu speaking audience. It has like people from across the country starring in it. So we have so far seen South Indian films taking over the North Indian audiences. If we see they are crossing over the border, how long do you think it will take for the same to happen with Bollywood film? The last time everybody saw a film I remember is probably Chennai Express beat in terms of marketing.
1657257338.0-1657284840.0
Like Sharrukhan coming down to Chennai and Sharrukhan going to igbat like in terms of marketing or in terms of the entire nation talking about that film on that La state, I remember Chennai Express. So what is the film that you remember? And do you think Brahmastra has a chance to repeat the success of films like say RR and Kgs. We will start with you. Okay?
1657287850.0-1657303194.0
I think it's a manufactured buzz. Because what I mean is that this film will be the one to cross borders. Bollywood films have always been crossing borders. I remember 25 weeks of Khushkuta happening in Chennai khona Pray Ran for a year. So this is there.
1657303312.0-1657335800.0
That's what I'm saying. The transition from Bollywood films to Chennai or a Hyderabad or a Bangalore has always been there. Kochin has always been there. It is just that when our films are going there, there is a lot of conversations about it. Because TM films being releasing here, getting the biggest screens, getting the longest run was completely par for the course for the entire time I remember of watching cinema and Channing being there and what Ramastra I'm saying Ramastra could release a Hindi film and still make the money.
1657336570.0-1657355926.0
The push for Thummer is just showing that now there's a technology. There is no space for these films to be dubbed and released. So now they are seeing the market for Thummer speaking audience enjoying a Hindi film. At the point I'm still saying is audience have always been enjoying Hindi films. Even without knowing the baseline language.
1657355958.0-1657370014.0
They understood the same thing with Telugu, same thing with Karada audience, same thing Malala audience. They all seen those films as those films. Now it is just fancy to say I'm releasing it in Tamar. Considering. I mean, considering I'm in Chennai.
1657370062.0-1657385794.0
How many shows does a Hindi film dubbed in Tamar have? The Hindi film as a direct Hindi film has more shows than a dubbed versions. Thing is you're giving them options. So a person who wants to watch can go and watch. The option will be that that is all for Ramastra.
1657385842.0-1657413838.0
If it has to mint that money that it wants to mint it will be through the Hindi versions only. Thing is, if it has to make that money that let's say a KGF made or a tripler made ranbir Kapoor Alyabad have to come to Chennai, have to go to Hyderabad, have to go to Bengaluru to do those shows. Otherwise it's not going to happen. Because he has not had a release for so long. Alibaba has not been part of ayan Mukherji, has not been part of the present.
1657413924.0-1657438290.0
I'm seeing the last five, six years is where this 100 shows have become 200 300. That movie going audience has since seen run video, hasn't seen ayan Mukherjee's films. So it requires a tremendous amount of publicity. That has to happen because otherwise people have wanting to watch Ramastra. I'm pretty sure or waiting towards Ramastra are not the ones who be watching it in Kamal Telugu or Hindi or Maryalam or Kananda.
1657438370.0-1657464240.0
They will watch it in Hindi, right? Of course. Do you think this will be the case despite Rajam Ali presenting it in Telugu? Santalya he's presenting it like Karanjohar presenting bahugali in Hindi and getting profits more than what makers got in Telugu is still unused. Do you think that can happen with Rajmawi presenting Brahmastra in Telugu speaking and States?
1657465090.0-1657496038.0
No, actually no, I don't see that. Happening because as you pointed out in Hyderabad, most of them speak Hindi as well. So there is a large part of city that speaks Hindi and that is the case with the whole of Telangana. Let's say if we take Andhra as. A market, the people who speak Hindi are quite less compared to what Telangana, Telangana people speak there.
1657496124.0-1657508862.0
Maybe there might be a post because. Of Rajivoli presenting it. But as such, as Avinat pointed out, there was always a market for all of these films. And if A film releases in Telu. As well, I will definitely go and watch it in India only.
1657508916.0-1657520706.0
Because that is how we are used to. We do not want to see where there is like lipstick also matters, right. For a cinema experience. So we do not want to see that. So I will definitely go and watch.
1657520728.0-1657542166.0
It in India only. But having said that, the buzz that our films are creating in north is because I think the films are able. To crack the B and C Center. A center is never a problem I see here also, as Avinas mentioned, either. Of us, Shennai, Bangladeshi are never a problem.
1657542268.0-1657559890.0
The problem is the penetration that they. Are trying to get into B and C Center. So that we have managed to do. Because as Avina mentioned, Hollywood has been known for a lot of things. They are not making for B and Cites.
1657560070.0-1657575970.0
It is very important for them to. Provide entertainment and that can be because. Of larger than life. And for over the last ten years, Bollywood has somehow blew away from you. They are making epic dramas, but not Hero hero films or Hero in Hero.
1657576310.0-1657597418.0
So that space they have been seeing in satellite. Because if you see our satellite, dubbed the satellite viewership, they are way more. Higher than what we actually received. So that space is basically that is. The reason why we sort of penetrated into B and C Center.
1657597584.0-1657608830.0
And for a normal average Pinney film also, those people are not getting those numbers. So that is the reason why Kashmir Files was also a raid, right? Because it somehow cracked beach.
1657611970.0-1657643734.0
And now Bulbulaya Two also cracked beach and C Center because people are happy to go to a movie and laugh for two to one and a half hours and come home. So the thing for Ramasa is also to come into talking in States and go inside B and P centers. But I don't think that will happen. Because do you think the content is too, let's say, eccentric like it's superhero? It's not something that B and C Center might have seen, probably.
1657643852.0-1657662714.0
But we have had Shaktiman we have had Shaktiman going to television across the country and it's like probably Pan Indian show. I will say so when we have shows like this. Why do you think do you still think Ramastra will have difficulty? Like, let me take Alyaba's example. She did do Zombubi, she did do Arrh.
1657662762.0-1657668290.0
Do you think that recall value will help her push for this film further in the south.
1657676230.0-1657692146.0
Even? I don't think so, because I think Alya in RRR was trying to attract in the best audience. But Rajam only was a bigger face than Arya, to be honest. Okay. And Gangubai did not do numbers in Bollywood.
1657692178.0-1657713630.0
Banglubai did not do numbers down south. And as Avination mentioned, Ranbir hasn't been. On screen in a big movie for quite a bit, quite a bit of time. And even Ayan in the same case with Ayan. So the bus might be there.
1657713700.0-1657729220.0
In fact, I like the trailer. Many of them did not like it. But I still don't see it penetrating B and C ten where you get the organic reach. Maybe if the first part is pretty good, maybe for second and third part, right?
1657731590.0-1657744360.0
KGF one wasn't marketed in Bollywood. It was marketed, but not to the. Extent KGF Two was. Look at the opening of KGF Two. It was way more the higher than error itself.
1657745630.0-1657759840.0
So that might happen because that is what we are expecting with Pushpa Two as well. The openings will be very good for Pushpa Two. So that might happen. But for the first part, I don't. See any penetration inside.
1657760690.0-1657787750.0
Okay? The next conversation I'd like to have is around the actors who become part of these pan and Jinfins. If we take Roja or Bombay, for example, we had Aravan Swami and we had a Manisha Pirala or Arwan Swami and there was Madhubala. But right now, if a movie is marketed as Pan Indian, they try to bring in casts from everywhere. Like in pushbar, you have farad fuzzle, right?
1657787820.0-1657805534.0
And in Triple R, you had, like you said, Alyabat and Vikram had fahath Fuzzil and Vijay. That's like abuse star cast. Do you think this kind of star cast helps pull in the audience? Like pull in the fan base of each actor? Or what do you think is the marketing thing?
1657805572.0-1657806160.0
Like.
1657809490.0-1657825090.0
It does pull in. There is a considerable pool when you have such names involved in the pool. But it isn't enough. The pool is not enough. Because if that is the case, every second multistar should be a huge success.
1657825160.0-1657847082.0
And another thing is the names you're talking about. Let's say even in Pushpai there is a Fadhat Fazal there. People came and throws to watch the film for allurgy fahad Fazal was the great bonus. We had his time in the last. We're expecting him to be a much more powerful space.
1657847136.0-1657867034.0
And second film, the first one, he comes in the last half hour types of things. So the film was pulled by so you need that kind of pull for it to be a banitive film. As Chandelier said, the KGF two was a big Kg. Because you didn't go for here, she went for Rocky bite. So you need to have that kind of pull for a character or an actor.
1657867162.0-1657879570.0
This actor is not famous than the character. It's a character which makes the actor famous. Like Rabbis was a big name in Telugu and to an extent even in government. But to make him apparent and start the Brahu Valley was what? Bush.
1657880070.0-1657896826.0
It isn't about the actors in the film. It's about how memorable the characters are. Like Asakira who was part of Chennai X was also didn't get the reach that a Qatapa gave him. That is the thing. Just because you have actors from across the reach it doesn't make your film get the reach that you have in your head.
1657896928.0-1657929090.0
It is those characters. That is why it may be the most cliched thing but again and again it's content is the thing. Just because you have the right places, the right actors and the right characters without that you will not get. For instance, Ramiya Krishna was part of Bahubal. It doesn't mean the films that she was part of the most iconic film.
1657939610.0-1657983030.0
You need to have a lot of factors for a film to get that pull. It isn't enough if you just have okay, if you want to make full release in Malayalama and you need to have a mall, it doesn't work that way. South Cinema which debt know his space five languages. You can't have one each from each list and say that's the representation that doesn't work because you are just doing numbers. You're not doing put to the characters.
1657984650.0-1658007038.0
So what is the meter that you register success on? For example, Sandal said that Gungubai did not do much numbers. But to be honest, it is the biggest hit of 2022 I think. And it is a profitable film for the makers. So on what basis are we saying this film did this much number?
1658007124.0-1658013840.0
And this is why it's not in comparison to say an RRR. How are we comparing? Are we talking about?
1658015890.0-1658031206.0
I have a couple of thoughts on this. The number game is very different right now because for RRS in Telangana and. Others the prices were very implicit. I bought a ticket for 450 or. Rupees and went to Rupees which we.
1658031228.0-1658037720.0
Normally do not do. So how do we compare that with any other movie? Let's say Vikram. If I bought it.
1658040090.0-1658049660.0
I can watch two shows of Vikram with one ticket. Price of RR at least in Telus. How are we comparing the structures metrics here?
1658051950.0-1658068838.0
Since from 2010 the 100 crores 200. Scores became very favorable. I think that is the bandwagon that everyone is jumping into. And now 1000 cross is a number that KDF and RR are seeing. But how do we sort of tackle.
1658068874.0-1658085750.0
Inflation in this number game? There. Is no such way. I think if the producers are profitable, which we do not know are not, in case of one another, because they had to do marketing twice, they said that the budget increased by one to. Third of what they initially planned.
1658087050.0-1658102234.0
I really do not know if housing. Tours were sufficient for them to have, let's say, a profitable I'm sure they. Have, but I'm just saying that the. Budget budget has also increased. So this number game, I don't know if that is the right metric to.
1658102272.0-1658120830.0
Say that the film is a good movie or not. And that is all the producers, producer. And distributors for them to decide if. That'S because the movie released today and by today evening, I see that I see a TV ad saying that blog. Post circuit is complicated.
1658120910.0-1658134020.0
How did they decide? I don't know. So I am very skeptical when it. Comes to numbers and when it comes to it as such in this sense. Okay, avinash, what do you think?
1658136470.0-1658138360.0
Yeah, I don't believe in numbers anyway.
1658142510.0-1658167626.0
The numbers are determining the film's success. It only caters to the number they watched and the kind of money it makes to the producer. Otherwise, there is no real so sorry, so otherwise there is no real metric. You have to understand because just because a thousand people went and saw doesn't make the film a good film or a great film. Just that a lot of people the film reached a lot of people.
1658167748.0-1658219490.0
I don't believe in numbers because we have seen great films not making numbers at all. For instance, we talk about issues in the film, but then I like, what? Aliya and I always believe that the numbers should be spoken by the people who are hoping that people who watch this talk about what you like, because the moment you get into the tool, you start doing unnecessary match. And then it happens across the board. Losing the essence of let's not go that far successful, like six years back, every day wasn't about the numbers.
1658219560.0-1658246170.0
It was about the film reached. Such markets, became such a huge hit in case of one was appreciated. We still spoke about how relatively unknown industry had given us film. But people who have been following Karasima understood why this film reached that place, but then outside of jail. So the point is still that we have somewhere stopped thinking about the goodness of how a film is reached about the numbers.
1658246240.0-1658265002.0
Again, in that competition. You're forgetting how, like what Chandelier said, small SMEs films, small jiraati films, films. You have stopped enjoying watching films. It's all about, okay, I'm contributing to that 100,000 crores by watching it five times. No, you have spent five tickets.
1658265066.0-1658274594.0
That sorry, what exactly are contributing to? You have got no idea. Is it for the promotions? Is it for the regulation? Is it for the producer's hand?
1658274632.0-1658289682.0
You don't know. So we don't know the specifics of these numbers we just fancy to see thousand 300 or 350 or 475 we clearly don't know who that money goes to. Where does it go to? Is it dumping? Does it go to the different different languages?
1658289746.0-1658342762.0
The worldwide draws is always a star next to number to say a property to supply or just the the regular audience. So this this discussion has joined the regular audience's conversations. I find that to be a little problematic right? So speaking of numbers reaching the regular audience and how it is now sometimes it's even people have started to believe that 1000 crore film is worth watching than a smaller film which might be better right? So let's take triple seven Charlie it is a film that released across India but we see that the film has done wonderfully in Canada but that has not been the case for the other languages that the film released in but that is not to say that the film is bad.
1658342896.0-1658358350.0
So in cases of pan Indian cinema good cinema that failed what is your opinion on how that could have taken place or could it have been better? Do you have any opinion on that Sandal?
1658361650.0-1658379918.0
No, I think they know that they. Have a market and that is the reason why people try to release it. But what happened in Telugu industry was there was Nani Salim getting released the. Same day and people actually did not. Go to any of those ante.
1658379934.0-1658413742.0
Senate is also not being very good at blocks of is what I am I see complete that is also because. There is a petty coming in because. Lot of big movies scale in May and April audience are pretty tired of. What I think after Vikram I don't think audience are ready to go to any other movie but having said that after Valvali right? Rabas did not have a kick even though he made a couple of very.
1658413796.0-1658433746.0
Big budget voice, he did not have a hit, but he's still continuing to do that. So I don't know if whether the. Makers have to introspect or the actor. Has to prospect, but that is that. But having said that there is a movie called Garada Gamma Isaba in Garada which is by far the best movie.
1658433778.0-1658456286.0
I've watched in 2021 but as Avina. Mentioned it a lot of Orient don't even know that movie exists. So that is the problem with this. So called Panic and Tag because there. Are a lot of good movies that go under the current and you speak about a few numbers and when a current job comes out saying that if.
1658456308.0-1658465918.0
KGF is made by Hollywood, we say. That no, we'll appreciate that. But that is not the case. Only because KGF came from Canada industry. That people access it.
1658466004.0-1658478850.0
That is the point what Karanjar was also trying to make but people found offense there also but something like Garrett should have been appreciated but is not. Appreciated.
1658484250.0-1658515054.0
I think to take on what Shadow is saying that the real success of film. I'm looking forward. What I see as panambian is let's say work here. A governor should work here. That is when a field is that is the market that should open.
1658515172.0-1658533846.0
And I have a huge my understanding is if I can enjoy a brahmastra they should enjoy they should enjoy Arrr and Telugu. We are catering to that audience is something. It's purely our market. It's a very business perspective. It's a commercial thing.
1658534028.0-1658553174.0
The reality should be if it's Ban Indian film hope. It's purely a hope like how a Mahayalam film like Kumbalangi Nights was celebrated for being a Mahayalam film. It wasn't dubbed into language. Similarly, films by Shekar Kamala is Telugu. We enjoy it here as a Telugu film.
1658553302.0-1658575314.0
That should be the case going forward. I didn't wait for Chakti India to be dubbed in tumble. I washed that mold. Should happen that they can watch those films also. They should know what Shankarabanam was.
1658575352.0-1658576180.0
They should know.
1658582230.0-1658599100.0
That is when you really have that Ban Indian label that every Indian watch film and understand what will happen. I just simply remember what Yash once told. He said I was talking to about the Kanana films that you think everyone should watch.
1658601230.0-1658617150.0
We all watched Tumbled sitting in theaters in Bangalore happened to our films. Why can't someone sit in block?
1658643070.0-1658656780.0
I'm pretty sure someone can enjoy it. Should happen that way. That is the next step. We will surely get there but across.
1658659650.0-1658685878.0
Okay. On that note, I would like to know one film that you think audiences should watch in the language that it was conceptualized in. From maybe Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, which is a language like Santalya had mentioned. Guru Dhamuna Rishabhahana. So something like that that you wish the audiences across the country would give a chance in the native language that it was conceptualized in.
1658686044.0-1658687510.0
Let's go with Avi.
1658691530.0-1658749190.0
The top of head say easy to water color because it has all the things that every regular commercial audience also watched. Super data and otherwise other films are there instead of I genuinely wish people watch shaper communal pornography because very wrong conception of what television wills are. It's not just that I'm saying that is also as much as pushpass that scale of should not boss a cinema under just one genre. I think that will have tte people will start exploring if we can sit this will watch a dark in Germanagana in Ghana.
1658781370.0-1658794854.0
Right? What about you? What funds do you have to suggest? Yeah. Anti senator Amiki is a definite watch in saliva and his previous work also.
1658794892.0-1658812110.0
People should watch it in Salulu or other languages because you can see the essence of what the writer is trying to say. I hope whoever is working on subtleties. Is because most of like let's say Sagara Sangam is a brilliant work by the master.
1658815170.0-1658821090.0
Is a brilliant work. I don't think that is needed any other language that was air only in television.
1658827830.0-1658841590.0
Sorry, Avinashan, your voice is we are not getting you. Your voice is breaking.
1658845950.0-1658846700.0
Okay.
1658851390.0-1658855440.0
It was made with Kamalasan. I think he's trying to say that.
1658857810.0-1658858560.0
Okay.
1658862210.0-1658867230.0
And most of the Malayalan movies, they are very authentic.
1658871730.0-1658888034.0
I saw Sudani from Nigeria, which is. A very again, rooted story that they. Were trying to or Angamala dairies of. Leader USA Princess they remaded in telku. But they again brought a different flavor.
1658888082.0-1658904300.0
To angamala has a different flavor or an EMA of leadership. We can't sort of dump or remake. It into other languages. So having said that, I have another point.
1658907070.0-1658923086.0
What have we not been mentioning, right? Let's say washed in sync by Hindi. Folks in that is what is basically. Happening with RRR overseas. People are watching it in Telugu and going mad.
1658923118.0-1658932050.0
That is what the whole encore RR is. RR. I don't think it is properly updated to English. But people are watching it in the. Native language and they are enjoying the Richmond.
1658933210.0-1658948120.0
So that barrier, if you are able to break within the country like Algas mentioned, that is what truly Parity has built. Otherwise, there is no point of us test something over a couple of movies that break.
1658950810.0-1658967230.0
That was wonderful. That was wonderful. Thank you to both of you for answering our questions and being a part of this panel. Thank you so much. Our audiences, thank you too for your wonderful camaraderie.
1658967570.0-1658973530.0
We hope to see you in another round today. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day. Thank you. Bye.

{"summary": "Deepstrate is a strategic consultancy and think tank. We are very proud to have this platform because it's completely designed by Indians, funded by Indians and traded by Indians. But it also ensures that here people can come together, have conversations, Shashi: We are at a very critical juncture in the geopolitical scenario. We've seen the power of platforms. Platform someone who is a very prominent public voice, for example, Shuki Pulkin: How do you think Nation should tackle with regulating these platforms? Especially, for example, let's say, D platform? India already has regulations around this. Such regulations exist across the world. US has and India legislated the It rules of 2021. There is no specific provision which will look at deep platforming, but there is provisions on content. There could also be principles. For example, she referred to these anti Clara principles during its time in India. We also come up with our own set of principles, if not regulation, but at least principles, so that there are certain guidelines and best practices which apply to us in our cultural context. A lot of the users of the handles are anonymous and they don't have the same kind of accountability that someone who willingly identifies themselves. So there's an interesting question that has come up. There are sovereign nations and how do they deal with say, transactional tech platforms that may be working towards goals Some social media companies have taken the government of India to court. One company took the government to court saying that some of the takedown notices are against the principles and constitutional right of freedom of speech. There are certain challenges which are unique to India, so they can't be a universal yardstick for free speech and so on. In a country like ours where the state capacity is limited, the threshold for violence is quite low. So I would say we are still in the early stages of regulating these. Shashi Bhatti: Government is considering self regulatory organizations for content takedown and content blocking. He says the government is not averse to the idea that the platforms themselves come up and create an effective regulatory model. There is scope for coming up with a set of norms, values, digital norms and digital values, how you conduct yourself. There are sunscars that are taught in every family certain values. Perhaps you should have a digital sunscar concept rooted in Indian culture, which also talks about how There's a whole lot of user generated content which you don't have in broadcast.

So you need a regulatory framework which is India's model for the public broadcasting is very different from the rest of the world. BBC barely operates less than ten channels, a handful of radio services. Durhushan operates 30 plus TV channels, all India Radio operates 400 plus radio stations. There is also a case for the public view to be put out there from the government or the state. I don't think you can wish away this role, this space for the state, for the government, but at the same time, yes, you have Google has reached out to the business platform that they have started working on, rewriting these terms of revenue sharing. How do you balance the transparency of the algorithms and the intellectual property and the innovation? I think it's going There are intellectual property concerns with respect to public disclosure of algorithms. Some amount of or some kind of independent review of these algorithms is important. There are no intermediate steps and there is no appellate process. Sudhi:"}

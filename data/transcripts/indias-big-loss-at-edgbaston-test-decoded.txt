Hello, everybody. This is ayas mehman on the show called Cricket with ayas Maiman on Kulkay. And we've already announced what our first show is going to be about. We are discussing India's big loss at the India Bastin test. That was the fifth test of the series.
1657313714.0-1657329594.0
India was losing two one and went on to lose that series. And therefore the series was squared. India didn't win the series. I've got with me senior journalist, sports journalist Vijay Lokapali, formerly of The Hindu. He still writes for The Hindu and several other publications.
1657329642.0-1657365274.0
He's an old, old colleague of mine in the sense that we didn't work for the same newspaper, but we were on several tools together. We've covered sport for a long time, over almost for about 40 years. Vijay, if I remember correctly, that's how long we go back. It's a pleasure to have you on the show. And I know this is actually a very prickly subject in the current situation in Indian cricket, because while for the most part of the last two, three years india has been the number one team in Test cricket, when it comes to the crunch, it's been a flop show.
1657365472.0-1657394046.0
So. Last year in the world Test championship final, india played New Zealand. Everybody thought India was going to win and India lost. Then when India went to South Africa, a beleaguered South African team, not at full strength, but after winning the first test, we ended up losing the series. And now in England, when we went to England, yes, there were some issues about players not being available, injuries, notably Kayl Rahul, Rohit Sharma.
1657394078.0-1657410520.0
But still, people or everybody thought and despite England's golden run against New Zealand, the belief was that this Indian team will get the better of England. And so it seemed for the first four days of the match. And then we go on to lose this match.
1657412730.0-1657432750.0
It's not something easy to it's not palatable, it's not easy to digest. Brilliantly as England played, chasing 378 in the last innings is a big let down. You know, this is one of the largest totals to chase. So very quickly, I'll toss, put the ball in your court. What do you think went wrong at edge vested?
1657437350.0-1657464250.0
Did anything go right? I asked you, and I have been for years, written all these folk stories from different corners of the world when India would lose from winning positions. You know, especially you and I, I'm sure you can never forget what happened at Barbados in 1997. So you were there and many more occasions when India should have won the Test match comfortably. They would have lost in one session.
1657465070.0-1657486702.0
And here, who would have thought, honestly, that India would be I in fact, tweeted England to lose on the third day. It's very intriguing. That how India can kind of invite defeat. It's known for known to do this. And it had the bowling, it had the batting and fielding especially was a let down.
1657486756.0-1657525574.0
So many factors which contributed to India's. Defeat, but to put a finger on some of the reasons and that's what I want to kind of pick your brains on and get your opinion. So we lost the toss and England chose to field and we were in a spot of bother losing three, four early wickets. And then you had Rishabun coming in and playing that absolutely brilliant, blazing knock, 146 and pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, so to speak, and took India to a fairly impressive score, 400 plus, which is what you expect a team batting first to do. And once you get 400 plus, the chances of you losing the test diminish.
1657525702.0-1657549006.0
Then you get 125 run lead on it's a massive lead to get and then you go on to lose the match. It it just boggles my mind. What I mean, the two causes that I can think of is not one is of course, we failed to get ten wickets in the second innings and remember, even in the second innings, england 109 for three. Yes. So they were in in deep, deep trouble.
1657549198.0-1657586862.0
But you had to either get the ten wickets or before that you if you had to bat out two and a half, 3 hours more, you would have actually pushed England out of contention of a win. Yes, the match could have been drawn and then you would have still won the series. So what happens is, from a good position, punt, batting again, making a half century, the last five, six wickets fall like, I can't say nine pins because they'll be incongruous five, six wickets falling like nine pins. But they actually fell in one great spell by Ben Stokes. He just cleaned us up and gave England not just a foothold into the match, but he opened up the game.
1657586916.0-1657626414.0
The game was opened up because now they had enough number of overs, enough time they didn't have to necessarily play for a draw and they went about their business in magnificent fashion. I haven't seen too many teams chase like this. I can think of the great Australian teams of the 1990s and 2000. I can think of the West Indies under Clivewide once they chased, I think, 300 score at Lords against England and won it with goddamn vintage, making a double hundred. But for this England team, which was before this series or before the series against New Zealand struggling they had lost to New Zealand last year.
1657626452.0-1657640654.0
They were thrashed in the ashes. They were trailing two one to India. Their biggest star of the biggest hero was Joe Root who was enjoying a golden run. But everything else was unsettled about the team. They also had a new captain and a new coach.
1657640782.0-1657646420.0
Everything suggested that this England team certainly can't beat this Indian team. But he also would come out.
1657648490.0-1657676560.0
I'm just wondering what would have been the state of mind of the Indian of the English captain when he discovers that you have opted to bowl and you've considered 400 plus runs in the first innings of a test match, you have to come back from there. Wouldn't have been easy. And like you pointed out, you have considered a big lead also first innings. So there have been occasions you were there. I asked Adelaide, 2003 or serious, 400 plus on the first day.
1657682450.0-1657705586.0
All these plannings can go haywire, but what did India do when it batted in the second innings is something they have to debate. And what was the bowling on the last day? Yes, it's the fourth innings. There has to be some wear and tear. I can understand conditions were still continuing to be good for batting, but you have to exploit the fourth innings pitch.
1657705778.0-1657728814.0
We don't have the skills or we don't have the will to go and fight. So England was the one which was pushed back to the wall and India had everything going in its favor. I don't know. Look, I think India was very complicated when it batted in the second innings. Right?
1657728852.0-1657769210.0
That's a very strong word you've used. But I'll just try and draw your attention to what Raul Rabbit said, the chief coach after the match, that we need to find out what's happening to us in the third and the fourth innings. So in the third innings, I'm assuming that neither are they batting well nor boling well. And in the fourth innings, if you have to bat last, you can't save the match, or if you're defending a total, you can't defend the score. Now, this is in contrast to actually what happened in Australia in 2021, where after being hammered in the first test, being bowled out for 36, we went on to win the series defending as well as chasing.
1657769710.0-1657801814.0
Suddenly you thought then India was top of the pops and, you know, Abbith Harani Succinct, we have learned how to win, defend, chase everything, and especially overseas against stronger opponents. And then suddenly you're back on the back foot again in the WTC against New Zealand, against South Africa, with a rookie team, in a sense. And then this English team, which actually was struggling till this summer, until about a month and a half back. So one word which comes to mind. You mentioned this.
1657801852.0-1657820730.0
You use the word complacency. I think there's no tenacity when you have a date, three, 4 hours to bat out and save the match. But does it not surprise you when you say the absence of tenacity with Ravid as coach?
1657822750.0-1657838894.0
That is the conundrum that you would expect with Rahul Dravid as the chief coach, the first thing that they would get is tenacity. But it's now the third test match. I mean, Ravi Shastri was in charge when they lost in the WTC final to New Zealand. But, like, you know, things haven't changed. Now.
1657838932.0-1657847982.0
Rahul dravid is captain. We lost two matches in South Africa and we've lost one against England. So I'm sure that he must be very miffed. Also. He was in fact quite distraught.
1657848126.0-1657875420.0
One could make out in the press conference. But this is a serious issue and I'll tell you why it's serious. In the last four, five years, it's actually your bowlers who have set up the victory situation for you. A platform for victory whenever you're playing overseas. Bombara Shami Siraj, Umesh Yadav, Bhomeneshwar Kumar, whoever has been the pace attack of India has always been setting up in the last four or five years, putting the team into an advantages position.
1657876130.0-1657894206.0
Sometimes you won. Like last year against England, you are two one leading because the bosses really did well. And Rohit Sherman and Kayl Raulbacked. Well, in Australia, with all the big guns missing from the test series, barring maybe Rohit was there, but he joined late. Except for Pujara and Rohani who were the big guns.
1657894238.0-1657916140.0
Even Pujara and then got injured. So what is it? Why are we still so wobbly? You would think that by now saving and winning a match would become second nature with this bunch of players who've seen the reached a crescendo in Australia and now you hit the pits. It just seems to me to be a bit of an alarming situation.
1657916670.0-1657926846.0
Correct? Ayas, it is like you would send a rookie reporter to cover a test path. He will give him his best. He wants to impress Ayas, my sports editor. He has to do his best.
1657926868.0-1657943214.0
So he will work very hard to deliver a good report. So that's what happened in Australia. You had many new faces. All of them wanted to secure a place in the squad and make history and set examples, grab the opportunity. And that is what they did in Australia.
1657943342.0-1657961050.0
Right. And South Africa again, India was exposed to their fellows, to their what should I say? The shortcomings against the fast bowling people here. Anderson, at his age is making Mickey of your best battery. Yeah, that's true.
1657961200.0-1657978350.0
Ben Stokes comes and he contributes by taking five wickets. So they had everything sorted out. I think they were better prepared. Whatever you say. They had a good series again, New Zealand load out and they have a coach who wants them to go and play aggressive cricket.
1657979490.0-1657996130.0
And also, it is like you look at the cricket with Rishabhandh play in the first inning when he was batting. Would you have honestly thought that India was going to lose this match on the final day? Certainly not. In fact, I thought he had hammered them into submission. The way he went.
1657996200.0-1658014714.0
He took his chances, played a high risk game, whatever it may be. But 146 in that situation was a magnificent effort. And you would expect the opposition to be kind of after that, be under great psychological pressure, but it didn't happen. But let me just focus quickly. How much did India miss rohit Sharma as a batsman, of course.
1658014752.0-1658019450.0
And as a captain. India. Miss Rohit. Sherma the batsman. More.
1658019600.0-1658036986.0
Because what happens is, yes, captaincy, there are times when your coach will send a message or your vice captain will send a message. Virat is there always on the field. He's chatting with the opposition also and with this captain also. So India did. Miss Rohit the captain.
1658037018.0-1658059990.0
But Rohit the batsman was definitely missed because he is an awesome presence at the crease. You look at ayaz I don't know if any batsman in Indian cricket in the last decade has had so much time to play the ball. I mean, you have won so much cricket all over the world. You show me one Indian Batman with so much time to play the ball. The ease with which he begins to dominate.
1658062190.0-1658078154.0
Either he will dominate I've seen him struggling at the crease. He will get out or he will make the botholers very embarrassed. So India definitely miss Rohit the best one. And now look, when he comes back, you will see the difference in the one day. Hopefully.
1658078202.0-1658091714.0
I must just add your Panish agarwal is also on the round table. He's joined in or at least he's participating in our conversation. And he said the message. Let's not forget, Sir Ravindra Jadeja's contribution in the match. And he is absolutely right.
1658091832.0-1658109346.0
Because at that position to come in and that partnership 222 runs, I think, or whatever it was between Jadeja and Punt. But I asked Ravindra Jadeja also came in because he could bowl. And look at the line he bowled. It was so disappointing. But that is a tactic.
1658109458.0-1658134074.0
I'm going to discuss that because this is not of his own volition. You don't bowl 25 28 hours on the same line unless it's a strategy or a tactic. It bombed in Boomerang. But just to relate it to the captain's issue, sorry, Roy Sharma is not there. Do you think it was prudent to get Jasprit Bumrah as the captain?
1658134122.0-1658147438.0
Because he's not even captain the club team. And yes, he was the vice captain because Rahul wasn't there. So he just got pushed up the order. But he's the main bowler. He's the spearhead of the innings.
1658147454.0-1658162422.0
And even in this match, you take Bumrah out of the equation. England would have never been in trouble. Oh yes. It's his bullying in the first innings as well as in the second innings that actually kept the Indian game alive. Indian alive in the game, but burdening him with the captaincy.
1658162486.0-1658175614.0
What do you think? Did it have any impact? What does this think about if you have made name somebody a vice captain, what would you have had in your mind? I mean, you had Risha Punt in the squad. Yes.
1658175652.0-1658196878.0
And you're looking at him as a future captain. They all talk about punts. He is able to lead, he's able to read the game. And he is one person who deserves a place in the squad. I mean, if he is not the captain, you will still pick him 3rd 4th member when you drop the list final eleven.
1658196974.0-1658230286.0
So I would have gone for Isha Pun given the responsibility, if not this next season, you will find Rishabun leading the squad, right? Because there is no guarantee that KL Rahul will be there as captain. Because if a new selection committee comes, it will look at punt very differently or the whole process differently. So I would have loved having Rishi punt as the captain and allowed Boomera to be a free mind and not add pressure of captaincy. And Bombara was not only thinking for himself by us, he had to think for ten others.
1658230468.0-1658259490.0
He's leaving the squad and he's not. Used to that situation. See, if he had been leading the team at whatever level he has some experience, I think it was in a sense unfair to him, the whole situation. You don't have your team's best batsman, Rohit Sharma is not there. You don't have Kayl Rahul in that sense, a little unsettled team and then you're put in charge.
1658259570.0-1658303658.0
But tell me, Virat Kohli was an option to be the captain. Now, I don't know whether they asked him and whether he agreed or disagreed or maybe they didn't ask him at all. But don't you think he was the most obvious option at that point in time? Yes, but if you go back, if you see the circumstances in which he had to relinquish captaincy the whole atmosphere in the dressing room outside, he was sort of eased out. And then for him to have accepted the captaincy would have been I think I can't ever imagine without coming back and leading India ever having he has decided he doesn't want captaincy.
1658303694.0-1658322700.0
So it intrigues me whether it was his decision or he was not even offered the option of captaining because this was an emergency situation. It's not that you're reinstating him as captain. Of course things can get complicated. If he becomes captain and you win, then you don't know what the hell to do. Exactly.
1658324750.0-1658370634.0
Related to Virat is also a supplement equation. Perhaps the most important question that one more test match has been below par eleven and 20 are not scores you expect, especially in a match like this where contribution so let me give you an example. When you look at England's performances, all the stalwarts contributed. Starting with Jimmy Anderson five wicket hall second inning, stuart Broad picked up a couple of important wickets, ben Stokes picked up four wickets, batted decently and Joe Root and Johnny Bestow. So all these guys have been around for eight, seven, 8910 years, some of them, the others in the second innings, the openers gave a good start.
1658370672.0-1658401522.0
Crawley and Lees, they are newcomers, which is fine. But I'm saying all the people who you would expect to perform well, they did. While in India's case, that is not the story. I mean, somebody like a Virat kohli. When we say that India didn't bat strongly enough in the third innings, the biggest disappointment, in my opinion, was Rat having got so we can keep saying he got an unplayable delivery, which he probably did, but Daisy's Okey has been stretching for two and a half years.
1658401576.0-1658428714.0
This kind of tepid form. I'm not saying that he is not looking in fact, he's looking in decent form, getting the starts and not converting it into a big score. How much of a rope do you think the selectors are still going to give him? Well, I think another season selectors are linked to backing, because every time they think they talk of replacement now, I asked, can you have a replacement for Virat Kohli? No, you can't.
1658428762.0-1658453254.0
You will have to groom somebody, you will have to look at somebody who can play that role at number four and also maybe talk to Virat if he needs to take a break. Does it help? I don't know, because some people, some former grades have said taking a break will not help him, which means when he comes back, he begins from scratch. Will it help him as if he goes back to domestic cricket, will that help him? Like former earlier they would do.
1658453292.0-1658465510.0
If somebody is not getting runs, they will go back to luxury. It will happen to Luckman, who went back to domestic cricket. Yuvra went back to domestic cricket. Sarah went back to domestic cricket. Sachin would never miss domestic cricket.
1658465670.0-1658478910.0
Do you think? Will that help? He needs runs, that's all. Whether in a four day game or in a three day game with the red ball. So once that happens, I'm sure Virat still has a lot of ticket left in him.
1658479060.0-1658496100.0
His reflexes are fine, his fitness is fine, he has the right temperament. Also, the only thing is, like they say, either he gets an unplayable ball or he plays a super shot. He's been terribly short of luck, there's no question about that. We saw even the IPL a couple of times. He got run out.
1658497430.0-1658539106.0
It looks funny, but it was Virat Kohli getting run out and going through his worst phase. You need that little luck. He gets a terrific delivery or somebody takes a great catch and you're gone. But what has happened also within all this extended period across formats, whether it's tests or Rhodi's or T, world's bowlers have got alive to the reality that Virat is vulnerable and the fielding captains. And if you put pressure on him sooner rather than later in his anxiety or whatever he made, he's going to make up, he's going to play a poor stroke or a wrong stroke, the stroke selection becomes the issue.
1658539208.0-1658572986.0
You can keep leaving the balls immaculately with immaculate technique for 30, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, an hour, and then you get one delivery which you fail to take your bat away and you're gone. Yes. So I think he needs to read this. What has disturbing me about Virat is that not his talent is in doubt or his class or his caliber, but in two years, or a little more than that is the last authoritative innings that I've seen from Virat was actually in the test match where India lost very badly when we were bowled out for 36. In the first innings, he made 76.
1658573088.0-1658603014.0
He looked at marvelous touch till he was run out over there and mixed up with a jinkerani. And since then, we have not seen any of great authority from him. He had a couple of half centuries in England last year. He had a couple of half centuries in the test match against test matches against South Africa. But he didn't look like the rat Kohli Benue would go and take charge of the situation charlize Pachas, banyao del Sooke because he's doing hundreds of fun earlier and put India into a situation there where you'll win the match.
1658603132.0-1658641694.0
That is not happening. And that is what is actually telling the bowlers that this threat we can throttle, we can kind of mute that threat from India because Virat is no NHL. And that's becoming a big problem for the Indian batting because while he looks in good nick, the scores are not there. I am not surprised that a man of his caliber kind of feels the pressure. There have been situations when he has scored under tremendous pressure and in different conditions, very challenging conditions against the best of bowlers.
1658641742.0-1658662434.0
So do you think it is something to do with how he approaches them in some mental state? Is he not there? Is he not? Sometimes you are near zone and you can play any ball from any bowler anywhere in the world. But there are times when you are vulnerable against even the average mediocre bowler.
1658662482.0-1658693650.0
So do you think he has he has something here which which he has to sort out before he can come and backfill. If you're a player of the credentials of a Virat or before that a tendulkar or rohit today or going back in time, rahul Dravid or these guys are mega stars of the cricket world because of their deeds, not because of anything else they do. Because of their deeds. Everything else comes because of their deeds. So they are always under great pressure.
1658694070.0-1658711494.0
They have to be. Brian Lara was under great pressure because he had a reputation defendant. He was Brian Lara where Richard was under pressure. In India's case, I think the players are under even greater pressure nowadays because the following is humongous. We are following runs into millions and millions of people.
1658711532.0-1658730522.0
So the pressure is even greater. But you also expect these guys who have played for 7810 years and to thrive under pressure. I mean, Virat is somebody who thrived under pressure. The way he batted in South Africa in 2017, 1718, he was fresh as a captain. He lost the series.
1658730666.0-1658752910.0
But the way we are at the battered, he said, you know, you looked at him and he said, this guy is a world beater. The way he batted in Australia in 20, 14, 15, almost 700 runs in the Series, the way he batted in England in 2018, almost 600 runs in the Series. He was unstoppable. It's not that he didn't have the pressure then. In fact, the pressure was even greater because nobody else was batting runs apart from the bowlers.
1658752990.0-1658769270.0
The batsmen was not contributing. It was Virat, and Virat alone largely, who was putting up scores for India to try and defend as much as possible. So is it about pressure, psychological pressure? It must be, certainly. Is it about some technical chink?
1658769430.0-1658797170.0
It could be. I mean, somebody like somebody who joined the Roundtable Bay who says he read somewhere, or he remembers Mama asif saying, mama asim to Pakistan faster, that Virat is a bottom hand player and he's been figured out. And it will be difficult for him to attain the same old standards of old because now everybody knows about this. I don't know. I mean, this is something that Virat will have to counter, which runs.
1658797510.0-1658799670.0
Mamadasi was a very clever bowler.
1658802010.0-1658825114.0
And if he's being dismissed so often, it's unlikely that Virat himself doesn't know what is happening, or Raval Rabbit doesn't know, or the batting coach, Vikram Rahul doesn't know. So if that's the kink and see, where do you iron out the king? There are two places. Either in the nets actually, primarily in the nets. Primarily in the nets because you can sort it out in the match.
1658825152.0-1658836734.0
Then you have to play a higher this game and hope that luck stays with you. And then you get a score of 40 50. But even the technical weakness remains. It will remain. Even if you're 50 60, you'll still play a weak shot.
1658836862.0-1658856034.0
Yeah. So the nets is where and by all accounts, for the last two years, he's been absolutely fantastic in the nets. I've spoken often to Rabbit ASTRI, and his thing was, you know how Ravi talks. It can be very bombastic. He's a dada player.
1658856082.0-1658864438.0
Dada player. You don't question. You watch him in the nets and you say he's in great form. Great. Nick Rahul rabbit says he's a role model.
1658864524.0-1658881214.0
And the fitness levels that he's brought into Indian cricket and the way he bats, and he's done it for so long. So it's not that he's lost how to bat. He's forgotten how to bat. He's going through a phase. The only thing is that the phase has now become two and a half years.
1658881412.0-1658896462.0
It's become part of his cricket. Now it's become part of his cricket. So when he walks out to bat, sometimes I sense it's almost like a man walking out to his doom. A batsman walking out to his doom. And that was more pronounced actually in the IPL.
1658896526.0-1658915258.0
Every time he walked out to bat, I said, yeah, biga run out, some great catch, some great delivery, milgia. So he's not had the great best of luck. But surely there is work ahead for Virat. And obviously the support staff you talked. Of, say, a technical deficiency, right?
1658915424.0-1658944018.0
You can have it as a bowler, you can have it as a maximum. So what do you do if you are your technique is struggling. So if you remember one little piece of advice from Zaheera Bas changed moment, of course. Now, why can't say, Virat have an extended session with somebody like Sudden Gavaskar? I don't know if he's hired or not, but it's great.
1658944184.0-1658962406.0
It would be great. I mean, if Mr gavaskar cannot guide, then nobody can guide. Yeah. And Indian Critic is rich with players of great experience and of caliber. You can even go and talk to a lucky man because he's there.
1658962428.0-1658989366.0
In England, for instance, Sunil Gavaskar is there. You can talk to Venksakar, who was electoral, who chose Kohli into the team. These are guys of great accomplishment. Of course, you have to rabbit himself. I mean, even Sarah Gumballi remember on the Australian two in 2003 four, he went to Great Chapel and got 100 at Brisbane and we saved the series.
1658989418.0-1659016230.0
Got 100, came back as one of the first I mean the only captain at that point in time to have not lost in Australia. I think couple they also didn't win, didn't draw the series. Chapel and Gangly had a very rocky romance after that. And it fizzled out a different story altogether. But surely I think that Virat look, Virat has become an enigma from a master batsman.
1659016310.0-1659034494.0
He's become an enigma. And the sooner he gets out of this enigma, the minute he gets out of being enigmatic, I think Indian cricket starts zooming up because he is now so crucial, especially with Rahul not playing. Rohit was injured. He's the pillar of the team. You can't look at punt as the pillar of the team.
1659034612.0-1659041220.0
You can look at pujara. But Pujara is also of the same age group. He's also not, you know, 25 24.
1659043430.0-1659058840.0
But let me move on from Virat. And that's the other contentious part. Ashwin, in hindsight, do you think he should have played? And not in hindsight, not in hindsight, but plain talking while he kept out. He's the best spinner in the world.
1659062750.0-1659082640.0
It pains me to see Ashwin sitting out. It really pains me because when he's at his best, he's watching the match, not playing in it. I don't know. He could have definitely played here in place of Chargul Takur. And if Taku can bat, Ashwin can bat.
1659084210.0-1659101366.0
And this thing about they talk about pitch, not favoring spinners, fine. But Ashwin has his way of overcoming the challenges of an unhelpful pitch. Basically, he is a bowler who is attacking all the time. He's reading the game all the. Time.
1659101468.0-1659141634.0
And he's making life miserable for the batsman because you don't know what length he is going to bowl, the variations he brings in his bowling. And actually he's as enigmatic bowler with so much of variety, I ask, and plus the temperament, he is never scared of bowling to the best batsman. He's never scared when the captain hands him the ball. In a difficult situation, when everybody is being hit for runs or nothing is coming through in terms of a break. That's because he's a cerebral chap and he loves his mind battles with batsman, whoever it may be.
1659141672.0-1659165260.0
Maybe a Joss butler, maybe Ben Stokes, whoever, and he wants to be one up. That's the nature of the game or sport, isn't it? I have to be one better than my rival and I have to out think the guy. Not just out slank him on technique, but also in the mind. And Test cricket is so demanding, as you know, five days, that if you're mentally inert instead of alert, then you're gone.
1659165630.0-1659192482.0
Correct. This guy is never mentally inert, he's always alert. In fact, Zada here, but I'll come to Ashwin later. I just want to take a little time out and announce that actually, along with the show, we've also got a contest where we'll be giving out some very exciting prizes. And it's a very simple contest, but it still has to be got right for you or whoever is to get the price.
1659192536.0-1659209986.0
And my question is, when was India's last series win against England in England? Not last series win against England, but against England in England. That's not a question for you, Vida. You know it Pat. It's for somebody else who can enter the contest.
1659210018.0-1659221642.0
I'll just repeat the question. When was the last series win against England in England? I won't reveal further than that. I won't tell you the answer. You have to come up with the answer yourself.
1659221696.0-1659249026.0
But let me just go back to Ashwin now. One would have thought that last year, out of four Test matches, he played zero none. He was kept out of all four Test matches, though he had played the WTC final against New Zealand quite ironically and done reasonably well. He had picked up a couple of wickets in both innings, I think left out of all four Test matches. And Virat was roundly and Ravi Shasti were roundly criticized for keeping out the champion bowler.
1659249058.0-1659259190.0
And lo and behold, in the fifth Test match, with a new management in place, a new captain, he still left out. So it kind of boggles.
1659261690.0-1659282090.0
I'm unable to fathom what was the thinking because he's also a batsman. He's got Test hundreds to his credit. Yes, English conditions are different, western news is different, India is different. So you might not make the same amount of runs, but he's not somebody who's a rookie, who is not a number 910 or Jack or he's not ten. And Jack he can make runs.
1659282250.0-1659328170.0
He's value great value as a bowler. And I think in this match, they had the option to not play shardrul, perhaps sharrul Takur, because you had bumrah shami and you had Mahmud Sarah, three pace bowlers, two spinners in jadeja, you would play and ashwin. And especially, I think, if you're clever about how you kind of finalize your playing 11th after you've lost the toss and you are asked to do the exchange teams before or after the toss. Do they exchange teams before or after the toss? Nowadays in cricket, do they exchange teams before or after the toss?
1659328330.0-1659331790.0
At the toss, but before the coin is tossed?
1659333890.0-1659356614.0
Yeah, when you go there, you first. Exchange the team, then the coin is tossed. Or is it the coin is tossed earlier and then the teams are exchanged? No, you have decided you come with the team and use the papers, of. Course, because otherwise, what you can do, you lose the toss, you know that you are going to bat first and they have to bat last.
1659356652.0-1659382462.0
Then you include an extra spinner or you go back to a fast bowling. Maybe that option will come in the days to come. Yeah, maybe that option will come. Anyway, I think that, and this is hindsight that leaving our ashwin didn't pay or it didn't work at all in terms of India's strategy. Especially when you had to defend 378 and you needed them.
1659382596.0-1659402342.0
And they're extending into the fifth day when you expect spinners to do something more than what your fast bowlers would have done. And that didn't happen. So that, I think, was a big blow. But looking I know we've talked a lot of what the reasons and causes of the defeat were. What is it that impressed you?
1659402396.0-1659439434.0
Is this something that which is a positive takeaway from this match from India's point of view? I think, to me, not because I like this guy a lot takeaway will always be vishapun the way he handles international cricket. I mean, you look at the authority with which he batted in both the innings, right? He played a stupid shot to get out in the second innings, but then that's too much to expect from somebody. He's contributed 200 rams in in in an away test in England.
1659439562.0-1659465306.0
You he has done everything to prove that he is the man for the future as a wicketkeeper, as a batsman, and as possibly I would say I would pick him as a captain. Also, at some point, you will have to give him the responsibility and see how he delivers. So everybody was talking of Rishabhan being the next big thing in cricket. I think it's not next to late. He's already the big thing.
1659465488.0-1659511714.0
He's such a crowd puller. The way he plays, the fearless, intrepid kind of approach to the sport is so engaging. People will, as they say, when both of them and Richards and some of the old guys who have grown up watching when they would be on the field, bars would empty out and people would be standing and watching these guys play rather than sitting and drinking in the clubhouse or wherever else in the stadium. Punch is that kind of a player who will get spectators out of their whatever else they are doing and watch either on TV or follow on the radio or whatever else. And he's also in that interestingly he's in an interesting lineage of Indian cricket where we had dashers and wicketkeepers.
1659511842.0-1659539222.0
You might remember Fadok engineer Flamboyant Bushi Kundran didn't play too many Test matches, but he had a score of 192 against England in the early 60s. Ms Dhoni, who can forget him? It's a very interesting lineage that Indian cricket has. But do you think he's the worthy successor to somebody like an Adam Gilchrist? Are we seeing, you know, an emergency?
1659539386.0-1659552070.0
Adam Gilchrist actually made his Test debut after seven, eight seasons of domestic cricket. He was 27, 28 when he first played for Australia. Pushing 30, actually, and never looked back for the next eight, nine years that he played for Australia.
1659554170.0-1659571500.0
He was an extraordinary player. Extraordinary, yeah. So Punt, I know Adam Gilchrist because I had a bunch of little brief conversations with him. He is very excited with Richard punt. And the thing which he mentioned was that do what you want with this guy, which meant basically select him in the team, but don't ask him to change his game.
1659573630.0-1659601378.0
There will be times when he'll play the most ridiculous shot and get out. But he's more likely to win you matches if he's allowed to play his natural game than if he is told what to do, what not to do and kind of block or choke up his mind with all kinds of thoughts which tell him that what you're doing is wrong. He said, don't do that. And I quite agree with that. And I think I know the kind of player rishave or the kind of person he is.
1659601464.0-1659619110.0
He will have his way. He will not be influenced by what is being told to him to kind of change his game or his batting or his approach. He's never going to do that because then he will not be rishafan. Right? Because it will be very difficult for him to make all these adjustments.
1659619190.0-1659647966.0
You can always have one player who's making runs consistently in all most of them away from India. I mean, you look at the way he's ballisted Australia in England, in wherever he has played in the West Indies or South Africa. Right. So I'm very happy the way he is progressing. And like you said, yes, he does justice to the reputation of, say, Ms Dhoni.
1659647998.0-1659667882.0
I mean, he's grown up watching Ms Dhoni. He won't play like Ms Dhoni and that's what he's doing. And when he takes over as captain, you watch, he will bring in refreshing what should I say changes. And if you talk to him, he has a good cricket brain, you'd be very impressed. You can talk to him for hours and hours on the game.
1659668016.0-1659693890.0
And with Rabbit there in the dressing room, I think he is in the best hands when it comes to riding. So fun to me was a pick of, like you say, take away from the test. So I met him apart from the matches where he's playing, the IPL once in a while bumps into his players. But I met him at Ravi Shastri 60th birthday. He had come for the party of the celebration.
1659694310.0-1659715514.0
One thing, what I find very endearing, he's always smiling. He's full of smile, he's got a huge smile on his face, he's got chubby cheeks and he was just looked a happy young man. And that's always so good to see, even on the field of play, when you see grim faces, you wonder that are they enjoying the game or not? This guy is always enjoying the game. That's great.
1659715632.0-1659768810.0
And when you spoke to him for a few minutes, you realize that he is so positive in his thinking. We didn't have a long conversation because he was at a party and I was also at the party, but you know, briefly you could make out that he's full of beans. It reminded me, AMA shares this anecdote with you, that in 2008 when India went to Australia, there were two captains, anil Kumble for the Test and Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the ODIs. It was an important series for India, turned out to be even more even controversial with Monkey Gate and whatever else happening. But in a similar situation, after the press conference and all was done, I met I mean, these guys came to a party restaurant somebody had hosted.
1659770270.0-1659799154.0
My understanding, if I remember correctly, myani Ilvan Patan used to put on some of the players who are part of the White Ball team. So I had a little chat with Ms. Zhoni there in that party and I said, what do you feel about this tour coming up, important challenge. Diego Ogira, he says, Jarnan, Australia. He pointed the finger, he said, Yahaba, there's no stepping back.
1659799192.0-1659819498.0
There's not Australia pitched. If you do all that, you've had it. And so as it happened, we won the One Day series. We won, if I remember correctly, the VB series or whatever it's called, the Test series. Of course, in controversial circumstances it went into, I think, two one, Australia one.
1659819584.0-1659843086.0
But I'm saying that the attitude will change. And as you mentioned, Rishabh Punt is somebody who's carrying the beaton from Masoni. Oh yes. So I'm full of hope from a guy like Rishab Punt and some of the others who are playing just to shift a little away from the Test team. Some of these guys we saw in IPL.
1659843198.0-1659852280.0
Yasha. Sweet. Jaswal. Including in the Ranji trophy. Some of these guys who are some of these guys from MP who won the Ranji final.
1659853290.0-1659863750.0
They were not overwhelmed by playing Mumbai? No. You might remember for donkeys you've covered even domestic cricket Mumbai.
1659867450.0-1659877066.0
In the dressing room. Why? Will they fear? Exactly. No, but I'm just saying that and the players the self belief that has come in is all a reflection of the rich talent that exists in India.
1659877098.0-1659900686.0
The point I'm trying to make is Rish upan is the leading light in that situation. Definitely. He's the guy who's actually leading this in the vanguard of this bunch of players who I think are going to lead India to a lot of success going ahead in all formats. Definitely. You mentioned Jaiswal Rajith Pathar.
1659900798.0-1659921340.0
Yes. Shubhang Sharma who wait those 400 very young, under 19. Gifted player. Not to forget Saturday's Khan, who he's in 909 hundred in domestic cricket. You cannot keep him away from Test cricket for.
1659924030.0-1659939150.0
Him into the summer. Like the pink circle who I spoke to yesterday or day before. He says that he is one step, just one knock away from one knock. Not in the innings, but knocking on the door. Yeah.
1659939300.0-1659956390.0
And he's saying, actually, why should the selectors wait for the knock? Also, almost 2000 runs in two seasons is a fantastic feat by any stretch of imagination. Yeah. And beginnings. He's always beginning.
1659958090.0-1659971878.0
Temperament is tremendous. And he's a big innings player. Strong before let's just finish off towards the end with the tail enders. We spoke of Bombay as a captain. But I think we must talk of him as the bowler that he becomes.
1659971974.0-1660000502.0
Obviously the linchpin of the attack. Whether he is bowling on subcontinent pitches, overseas pitches, overseas pitches as different as New Zealand, England, South Africa, Australia, West Indies, wherever. He just seems to get success everywhere. And five years back, everybody said he's a white ball specialist. To give credit where it's due, it was Shastri and Kohli who pushed him through into the Test team first.
1660000556.0-1660021210.0
Got him into the squad, took him there, pellet testimony, South Africa and he's not looking back since then. And the combination with Mama Shami mama Shami, I think is one of the most luckless bowlers I've seen. By now. He should have had about 30, 40, 50 wickets more in Test matches. Shami never gets his due.
1660022750.0-1660040370.0
We are talking about bumrah. We should talk about Shami. Shami last four or five years he's been your principal bowler against good batsmen. He gets you a breakthrough. He brings you back into the game, whether it's a one day game or a Test man.
1660040440.0-1660056006.0
And he's such a wonderful bowler to watch his action, the way he approaches and with a smile on his face. He's not always got a scowl on his face. Boom. Also gives a smile. Yes.
1660056028.0-1660067742.0
That's a great quality. Actually, even just with Bomba has got that quality. He'll smile if it catches dropped, he'll take it with a smile. His guns are conceded. Spinners, fast bullet.
1660067826.0-1660075050.0
He takes it with a smile. Absolutely. They used to say smiling assassin. Right. Earlier.
1660075570.0-1660083680.0
Right, right. But I think Smiling Assassin is this. Guy they used to call Michael Golding. Whispering that. Yes.
1660087570.0-1660099438.0
Sorry to come to this attack. Your spirit is bumrah. And your opening, his opening partner is Shami. Siraj didn't have an impressive game, though. He took four wickets, especially in the fourth innings.
1660099454.0-1660119558.0
I think he went for plenty. You can't hold one match against him because he bowled superbly last year in England. And of course, we all know what he did in Australia. But clearly there's a learning curve he has to climb for more consistency. But in terms of other fast bowlers, to make up the complaint, we've talked of the spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja.
1660119654.0-1660137920.0
You can't look beyond them for spin and test matches. Right now, if you are playing in India and you have ranked Turners, include a third bowler, which could be akshal Patel. But if you have two spinners to play, you have to choose between Ashwin and Jadeja. Or choose both. Yeah, choose both.
1660138770.0-1660152546.0
Now, amongst the pace bowlers who's been impressing Boomers, who is on the comeback trail? Umesh yadav thereabout. Even last year he made an impact with his bowling. There's some guys who come. Prasad.
1660152578.0-1660168730.0
The Krishna. Very impressive. These are some of the names that have come up. So India's Pace attack or a bunch of pace bowlers looks fantastic. And that should be which is why we are getting more opportunities to win matches.
1660169390.0-1660187578.0
But how to translate this potential match situation or winning situation into a victory is really the challenge. This is what Robert highlighted. Yeah. And also they bowled badly. Let us accept looking runs on either side of the wicket.
1660187674.0-1660204422.0
It's not easy. You can't set the field catches being dropped, not the great lengths they were bowling. And they were being hit. Everywhere you look at those shots which were played against the Indian fast bowlers, not a single shot was left except for the regular sweep. They were swept, they were covered, driven, cut full.
1660204476.0-1660219530.0
Everything was there but one off test, I think. I'm sure if there was another match, the same attack would have definitely pulled much better and the batsman would have performed better. And India? India, on paper, I asked whatever. I agree.
1660219600.0-1660238138.0
England has beaten India in the estimate. They had a good citizen. But man to man, I would still. Back English very quickly. Your views on Basball as it's being called now, england's approach of all out aggression like Joanne Croft cry Dutch team used to play total football.
1660238234.0-1660253030.0
These guys are playing total cricket in a sense. Just go out there and bang, bang. And it seems to have worked. It's the highest game, but my point is high risk, but it's not thoughtless. Look at the partnership between root and bearseau.
1660253770.0-1660269638.0
First they steadied the innings, then they consolidated the situation. Then they went after the bowling. Then they pasted the bowler and took the team to victory with overs and time to spare. But it was not frontal assault. He's wicked gear.
1660269654.0-1660294030.0
So it doesn't matter. It's not that I wanted to add this, because it's very interesting. A lot of people believe that Brendan McCullum, this is the way he used to play and this is what he is kind of infused into the England team. Yes, to an extent. But let's not forget that Brendan McCullum once made 300, I think 302 against India to save a test match in 2013.
1660294190.0-1660307730.0
Yes. So he's not bound. NATO wicket down. That means you close your eyes and swing the back. Either ball will go on the four or your wicket will go cut wheel.
1660307810.0-1660312410.0
He's not that kind of a coach. Neither of you that kind of a batsman.
1660314750.0-1660334586.0
He plays a great percentage game like Savag. You know how Savage used to work out the percentages in his mind and which to a large extent Punch is doing now. He takes the risk, but the percentage is now in his hot disk. He's able to work out the percentages very quickly. But I asked the same basketball didn't work in the first innings.
1660334698.0-1660352470.0
It didn't work. Yeah, it did work, but they're making it over century banana. I was saying, you know, they push. Avoiding the follow on and getting close to India's score was the reason why they remained in the match. I think they were being aggressive and India was being over aggressive.
1660356730.0-1660391140.0
Also. I think the strategy is in the fourth innings on how to defend as well as attack in the field with the bowlers and the field placing. When you listen to guys like David Gaur or some of the other guys on radio, you felt that India could have done better or some measures were taken a little belatedly to arrest the stem or the flow of runs, things like that. But it's a learning curve also for bumrah. Did you at any point feel, I asked that there were some inputs coming from outside?
1660391510.0-1660421100.0
I didn't feel I mean, they just allowed things to drift and then they reached a stage where they became looking so mediocre. Maybe when you bowled out a team for and got a lead of 125 or 30 to whatever it was, there is a sense of confidence and optimism. 14 method. It should be that much easier, especially with the spinner also in the side. But this is a cruel game.
1660422030.0-1660448050.0
One strong partnership can just cut the ground from under you and they turn the tables on us in magnificent style. You have to give it to Joe Root and to Johnny Bestow. As I mentioned at the start, very few such matches I've seen this kind of a finish. One match which I watched, and maybe you are also there, I'm not sure. 1987, westernly versus India at Delhi where Vivichards came and hit a century in the fourth innings and won the match on the turning track.
1660448200.0-1660471866.0
The threat was from Maninder and Shastri and whoever else, and you just cut them down to size with ease. That was liberated with ease. With ease. So these are matches which, whatever you may, India may have ended up losing, but you can't but admire and enjoy that game. The whole contest, as England played the game, from Jimmy Anderson's highly skillful bowling in the first innings and the age of all war.
1660471888.0-1660492290.0
He's pushing 40. He's only 40. And he's putting up batsmen. All along, I knew that he was setting up this guilt fellow, and that's what happened. He got rid of him and then he made somebody like Ashraf Ayer, whom India thinks can be a good press, batson for struggling.
1660492710.0-1660503266.0
Yeah. Again, he's a very clever Batman. He's also one of those who plays mind games in the Batman. I mean, his battles with Bilat Kohli have been the stuff of, you know, folklore, modern folklore, cricketing folklore. Yeah.
1660503288.0-1660525440.0
And it's I would say that it was it was almost 50 50, or virtually 50 50. Now. It tilted a bit towards James Anderson because of last year's series where he made he got him a couple of times again and stuff like that. But it's a great battle to watch. Highly skillful players confronting each other is obviously a great thing to watch.
1660538930.0-1660551346.0
Sorry. People like Anderson and Virat, they are the best ambassadors for test cricket, I think. Absolutely, yes. And now, increasingly, I have a great regard for Joe Root. Yeah.
1660551448.0-1660580506.0
You know, and three years back, he was also thought that his form is waning, gone century in E Bandratha till the 2019 Ashes Series. And then he hits this purple patch, which is the way he plays against spin. You saw him bat against India at Madras, the way he plays against fast bowling. The only place he's not made runs is actually in Australia, high runs against Australia, but everywhere else. And in this kind of a form, I have no hesitation saying he's the world's best batsman by a mile.

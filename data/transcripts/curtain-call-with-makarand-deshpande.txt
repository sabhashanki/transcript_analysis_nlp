Ah. Hello everyone. Welcome to Kulke and welcome to curtain call. We are here with a very special episode today with Makrand deshbandi. Welcome Makhrand and Nayadoor campaign.
1657238570.0-1657248280.0
Welcome. We're really happy to have you Makrang idea here.
1657251550.0-1657294760.0
I'm sure this is a question you've been asked a lot, but I know you were interested in sport and this was a very different turn that you eventually took to do theater. Yes, I was a cricketer college and I joined that college because they had wonderful and I happened to be playing cricket there. One of the senior students said that we are short of actors. They know that you have acted in school.
1657298490.0-1657343110.0
And they said one more thing because we don't have Marathi speaking actors. Okay? So they said, Would you just try it out? I'll ask myself. And I got chance and I just tried to not believe that the director is no more, but he's a Bengali director and he just first was so happy that he said an actor who's so fit and the line which had said that an actor needs to be an athlete first bought an athlete first.
1657343180.0-1657365120.0
That was the point. And he just said as actor on started on the right note who's the filmmaker now was playing the lead part. That's how I started. And when we entered qualified for the finals, he liked my performance so much that he increased my part.
1657368930.0-1657402214.0
Which means that I was confident when I could eat. And in fact and it slowly just so happened that from Marathi to Gujarati to Hindi, I was acting in almost all the languages. And there was a point where I used to shift from one rehearsal room to the other, then to the other, then to the other. That's how and then from there I used to go to the ground to play cricket. So cricket was still around.
1657402412.0-1657433698.0
You didn't give up cricket? I couldn't. I did want it. But there was one point at the age of 17 or 1819 maybe, I was at the ground and I thought that when I looked at my coach, my great player who said he works in a bank and maybe I'll also have to retire one day. And the thought of retiring from what you love the most troubled me.
1657433864.0-1657458086.0
And the next day onwards, they stopped, they asked me and I said, I won't come for net practice. He matches up to that and then whatever that time I get. And it was slowly a sportsman. I always say that I entered college as a sports person. And when I passed out, I passed out as an actor.
1657458278.0-1657483550.0
And when I passed actor, once you pass out, you become graduate, then you look for a job, right? I look for a job. I had this Amita group, Madhyam, and we had this theater company where people were doing experimental theater and eventually perform at Britville.
1657489930.0-1657506280.0
Tried working also as a salesperson. And just to help because I couldn't sell anything. Not good at selling other goods. I should sell my own good. That's where I should act more.
1657507450.0-1657530690.0
I started acting lucky while I was in college. There was a television made with Shafi Namdar. The seniors called because I was a known college theater actor.
1657532790.0-1657571214.0
Whether it was anything I did, as the youngsters would know about all these companies. And in those days, a serial to be made in 1980, 87, I guess, 87. And, you know, I remember still for auditions, you know, all students from I mean, I'm saying at least hundreds of students had to give an audition then to be part of television serial. And I was lucky. I didn't give any audition because they had heard about me and I got straight chance.
1657571252.0-1657580210.0
But also but that was my beginning.
1657594010.0-1657621518.0
I passed out, but I never left my college with my then principal. Mrs. Rai was so nice to do. What kind of contribution maybe not only me, but people like me have done for the college. So I could rehearse in the college even after passing out.
1657621684.0-1657660858.0
And in fact, I was helping my young college actors and would help them to direct, to write. And then slowly I found my own group. And that was the point. That was the point where it's a very interesting thing which not only I formed a group and I performed with theater, but I formed a group to perform outside, which is theater first platform. I called the group heads together.
1657661024.0-1657703960.0
So in those days, people keep coming from all over the part of the country to Mumbai to be part of this world. And they would come and they would just read this Heads Together, which meant was suppose fourthis come. And I rehearsed that day or that week with Gujaratisan, that a Gujarati play would happen, hindi, Cosmopolitan, anything could happen. And audience was always there. It was free, obviously, but every Saturday, Sunday is to perform.
1657705370.0-1657783360.0
And it used to be half an hour to one act and all these acts in fact, once there was a place which more than half an hour and it became I still remember that what I did was I said everybody said yesterday I did recapping and we started again.
1657786050.0-1657883680.0
Whatever we did something, many of them I have these Maurya brothers who themselves have won fair awards and whatever dialogue writers that we were performing such a close quarter that I remember right then, in 1993, just to take it further, prior to that I had performed, I was performing as an actor inside. And why did I write a full. End place and which was that full length, which was your first place? Freeman was my full land state. And that's again, the platform performance we have performed for two days.
1657900410.0-1657911626.0
Breaking a little bit, I think if you can move a little closer. Beach, may I miss this part? Can you hear me now? Yes, much clearer. You were saying it was a platform.
1657911728.0-1657934020.0
Performance and then part one was performed on a Saturday. Part two, this was in 92 and then 93, the same play. I wrote it as a fullland play and two act play. And it was one of those Avan God plays, experimental place.
1657937270.0-1657982580.0
It was again a great combination of actors passed out from NSC, from Mishra, myself, I was there. So the team was ensemble anilado. Again, I said Prashan Naran, who's quite a name now, actors came together and he did a play called The Man. And that rang the bell because then one of the important directors of Geta was Mahendra Joshi. He's also no more.
1657985350.0-1658010090.0
I have been fortunate to be directed by him while I was in college. I did Hindi plays with him, hindi and both. And he happened to see my retirement and director production. And he was so happy. And he had a great knack of designing lights for a play.
1658010240.0-1658018750.0
And he said that I want to design lights for a play. And then actually he told me that your writing is unique.
1658020930.0-1658047190.0
He supported me. There were two people who supported my Josh and Dr. Ranil Bandar. I think they supported me as a new writer and somebody who's writing what we have to see, right? That actually gave me the push that of course, I was criticized after that for quite some time by people that he writes abstract, he writes absurd.
1658049210.0-1658060970.0
What did you say to that? How do you react to that? I've heard this as well, that your work was seen as abstract. So what would you say when somebody said your place is too abstract?
1658064130.0-1658095698.0
When you're young, you have a chaotic mind. There are so many questions that you don't know how to answer them. And you are trying now to probe into some kind of reality to perceive. And then the history and reality can be told through your perspective. And that's where it becomes abstract.
1658095794.0-1658120654.0
See if you have to write about it. Riots of 93. Now, what do you write? You know, I mean, you there are other mediums called doctor drama documentary, which you can make it. But theater, according to me, one has to understand theater is something the medium about a dialogue inside you, not per se the research.
1658120772.0-1658163094.0
That's what I have always the problem with playwrighting is people. I feel the playwrights don't write what is happening in the mind of the characters or what is the situation, understand it and can you say it with metaphors? And that is how it's like poetry eventually got on stage. It becomes prose and use theatrical language to reach out to the audience. Which means that now, suppose if I have to write about I remember a play called Kutikumas and a Samarang.
1658163222.0-1658183250.0
Samrangal was about a battlefield where a conqueror, the victorious person, gets up and he says I am Alexander, but I am the victorious one. He had lost. I have one. But then he realizes there's another man who's waking up. He is also not dead.
1658183590.0-1658213658.0
And he says, I am the teacher. Now he gets up as a teacher, so he feels, okay, is my teacher. And then comes the real warrior, who's, according to me, was Ashotama, who was wounded, and he there forever. And he seen this battle, which was a fraud boy battle, battle. Now, this is a very interesting thing happened.
1658213744.0-1658235860.0
And I had really actors for that. I had this actor originated from Popal. Then I had Fazal Khan, who started working with me, who played the Alexander Anura Kashap played Ashok Thomas. Anurag was my actor. Then.
1658238410.0-1658255610.0
That's information I do not believe. And for that we should do training, because I wanted them to climb the ropes. And so I used to take them to the gymnastics school. I to take them and to practice.
1658258590.0-1658296280.0
Then I used to bandage it, because in that player here, they used to climb the ropes and they speak their dialogues for 100 years.
1658308090.0-1658331354.0
What is that? And he is actually following nature of darth it he has this flower who's connected. We have a must gira. So now I had, can you believe, a set in Pre three where I had flowers from Dai pitkillas. It was that huge garden.
1658331482.0-1658360170.0
And I remember Rashmi also acting in that. So what I did actually tell you, in those days, there was Act Azad. He was working for other theater companies. They all used to work with me. The question was about abstract.
1658365250.0-1658386930.0
I don't want to leave any chance of creation, right? So that was the onslaught. Because I remember the amount of work we used to do, money I used to spend, because I used to act in television or films. And whatever money I used to earn, I used to put it here. And why did I do that?
1658387000.0-1658417394.0
Because I was on a film set and I got so tired waiting for actors to come get ready. And I just thought that maybe I should use that time for writing. And I started writing. My mother was working in school and she was running a cooperative store for the underprivileged. And so she had a register to keep the accountant.
1658417542.0-1658476170.0
So one day I took it to the set and I wrote dreamman and my first dream and my original handwriting. And that's how my journey began, I would say. And then it was every year I should write two to three pulled in plays and wouldn't think that Kiyari I always had actors. I was just so fortunate. I must tell you about one actor who I feel was one of the most senior actors that pundits and is, according to one of the best theater actors I've ever seen or ever worked with.
1658476340.0-1658501254.0
And the whole theater voice, which an actor needs. He had presence, he had sense of humor. He had he knew, he understood emotion he could do if you wanted mellow drama, make the drama big. At the time, he could just subtle as well. And so he used to work in hipta plays also.
1658501372.0-1658565898.0
But when I approached him, he really didn't even think that whether this what kind of place macron do. But he knew that the intensity with which I work. And we did this place called Kasturi rathna Pataksha and Sudid Fundi and Munambaga were part of it. And Teddy Modiya now Ratna also again, I think I have to be thankful to Rathna because there were some seniors who always supported me for whatever I was doing. Whether it was wonderful filmmaker Gobin Nilaniji who gave us television or I'm telling you why I'm taking these names.
1658565914.0-1658568030.0
Because they really followed a career.
1658570530.0-1658607450.0
I would say the critics like Deep of the Halo for Midday then. And he used to give us preview also. Not only review, I still remember that he gave me a preview for Kasturi as Scent of a Woman. And then she loved the play. But Horashanta Gokli, he won Sahita award, some award from they were responsible critiques at that point in time.
1658607520.0-1658622590.0
But they themselves were writers. So they understood where am I coming from? And they welcomed the new writing. And whether it worked, didn't work. The only thing which I always saw was we always had audience.
1658623810.0-1658646854.0
That was the best part about the audience. Whether understood. I remember Nasiri used to save online is to come up after the show upstairs at Pritchard. If people have been backstage, it's on the first floor. You go, the green rooms are so he used to come sit, he used to congratulate the team.
1658646892.0-1658696130.0
And he would look at me and say now the whole point was mazalana, we used to work so hard, I'm telling you, so hard because of cross section of actors. If you see a Kkmen acting on stage I remember a play called Hitra. That is the first English play I ever did. And the play which I had not read because I was tired of my own writing. And I said to myself as a writer, I'm not going to look at you anymore.
1658696290.0-1658730270.0
So the writer stopped writing that year. And the director in me was in search of some play because I couldn't stay without doing a play. And then I decided I came across but it was in English and it was a small place, drama. There was just solely how to do this. Everybody thought, but I love the poetry of it and I love the drama.
1658730430.0-1658750600.0
And where I just told Sanjana now again Sanjana Kapoor I love to take apart There has been Pritchvi Theater. Without Pritvi Theater, unstatter group wouldn't have happened. Makani wouldn't have happened to this level. Because they really encouraged us to perform whatever we wanted to perform.
1658753370.0-1658774698.0
I asked Sanjana to play Chitra. That Chitranga, the character. And I asked Keiki to play Azul and both agreed to play. And then we had Amit Mystery, who's no more mother and wasan was played by Vijay Maura. The play which became a spectacle.
1658774874.0-1658813962.0
I still remember stunt I had done was opening of Chitra as a character who was born as a girl. Which means that the boon was given to her father that they would have a son and went wrong. So she was brought up as a son and she became a warrior. But what happens is when Arjuna in exile sees her but didn't even give a second glance. And she feels that he's not a woman because he was a man and she hates herself.
1658814026.0-1658847506.0
And she said, It's not my mistake. Your boon went wrong. And she does this Tapasia penance and where I had to show that how dreadful it was. So her entry was only there is an imagine blackout in theater. And all of a sudden a foot light is on and a head upside down, hanging comes into the light and screams.
1658847698.0-1658878286.0
An audience gets a jutka and that face goes back. So she was hanging on the rope and it was a stunt and it had to happen in darkness. Nobody knew that it was opening up the play. And I remember it was when Sabha Shikapura father was going to watch the play. And I said, My God, now who's going to hang her upside down in darkness?
1658878478.0-1658889540.0
And you are sitting. And that is the time I went myself to Hangar, Utah and I pushed her. He screamed in darkness. I got her back.
1658897530.0-1658951110.0
But I'm telling you, she worked so hard. And KK, I think it just so happened that it just became one of the best shows of great contribution by Teddy Mora versus costumes. As the first time, we not only designed a costume, but he still costume. And he played live music and we had some great imagery. And it became so good that I remember Napole Polika, veteran theater person as well as cinema star superstar in those times even now a terrific actor and a painter himself.
1658952810.0-1658986020.0
When he saw it, he said that Macaron is so beautiful that tomorrow if somebody tells me that Mukran is performing in a play or his play is happening somewhere in a remote village where I have to eventually walk on my feet, I don't mind doing it. Because this is you felt so good. So that was one of my I think the same. What year was this? What year did you do?
1658986710.0-1658999446.0
98. 99 sorry, maybe 97. 97. 97. Because after that 97.
1658999548.0-1659023978.0
Yeah. Because that is the play which I did. And after that I started writing again. And then I wrote Arab, which was on Ganesha's birth. And then I did Daywana, which was on Hanuman sitting in the flag of Arjuna, who's watching, witnessing Mahabarat.
1659024074.0-1659054694.0
And so I wanted to look into Mahabar. So I chose to see it from Hanumanji's eyes. And after sunset, what he has to say and he's so upset about the war and now you just want him to please sit back in the vaja and he's refusing. He's saying, I don't want to be part of this war. And how he has a dialogue with that, who made him Shiranji immortal.
1659054742.0-1659093430.0
And he left him to witness this war which he felt was not the right way to find. So it was again, even I'm talking about it, I just feel there was so much and in between imagine there was so many plays which we were still performing. I don't know how all it happened, but in that again, I'm saying I have to take some of the funded me because he was part of Kasturi, he was part of day One. He had just a Hanumanji push.
1659098650.0-1659144920.0
And I still remember he believed and everybody yes, there's some great memories of one can call it abstract, one theater. But I'm telling you, when I did 25 plays after 25 plays, the count reached 25. When I asked the audience who all have seen my first place and there were some hands around, yes. So I said, what is the difference then and now?
1659149210.0-1659170960.0
And they said, Am I telling the story better? Are you understanding the plea more? They said it was an interesting answer. They said that we never came to watch a story or we came to see your madness and you have not let us down.
1659174050.0-1659192440.0
You still maintain that over the years I've been in the theater when you're performing and I've seen people cheer, you think people still come for that? And have you tried to keep the madness intact? It's there all these years later.
1659198490.0-1659216240.0
He once told me your madness is you try and think that you want to do something which will be easy for audience to understand.
1659219170.0-1659256540.0
Don't be with your madness. I followed and I was fortunate that I had this vertical space. And you have audience almost looking here the heartbeat of that leave the thoughtless. You know, when actor is trying to remember his line that close and really lead audience as well, whether they are with your play or not.
1659258750.0-1659302310.0
Such a close proximity, intimate interaction that's called the real live theater, which is on the same timeline. Sometimes you cross over, the audience becomes artists and artist becomes audience. If it's that close, I think that and one of the best lighting, I feel source the angles which one could cover if people have not been those who are in come on 1213 14th. I have three days, two plays.
1659304990.0-1659321118.0
I would actually like you to speak about that. But before that, I want to stay in that period. The time that you're talking about, when Angeliata came into being. Let's hold on to that for a little longer. I want to know what were your contemporaries doing there?
1659321204.0-1659394470.0
You came as this director and actor who sort of broke the mold, who took theater outside the theater, contemporary skist typeca theater was there a lot of mythology that they were also doing, which everyone was following. See the Marati Theater and the Hindi theaters or the directors came from anthropology. They had a particular kind of play, which was a competition kind of play, which was very which had certain plot to win award. That was one kind of play where formula, just a formula competitions which had audience mob chorus and which had solely Lukeys to win awards collapse and drama. And then there was this professional theater which had box theater, which means giving the illusion of walls.
1659396170.0-1659415486.0
But they created bedroom, they created drawing everything. They could create a fridge, they could create everything. The properties were real. Everything was real trying to create. And eventually it went to the point where they had a tap and the water would come through.
1659415508.0-1659472794.0
It became so little. And at that point I was trying to create drama which enhancing a particular emotion like a story to create character the entry of because it was about womanhood trying to accept womanhood. And that was Karatna's character who has fear of male dominance. So how to show her anger was there was no door. There was like a big green and a sharp slide and there was a gong and she would allow it by banging the gong.
1659472922.0-1659476510.0
And now that was not the hammer, that was her shoe.
1659479890.0-1659505754.0
And that was deliberate. So it was interpretation every time. And when she used to hate men creating mess. Whenever man used to sweet Pandas cap, he would clean it up with her broom. But the broom hand, we had fixed it in such a way when she asked her to stop.
1659505952.0-1659510780.0
When the hand used to come out, stop.
1659513010.0-1659544520.0
Properties were telling more than reality, which would tell inner character, inner chaos, in our anger, in our confusion, in our fear. Properties also. So we created properties, we created sets and that's how apart and the acting style as well.
1659547530.0-1659566174.0
We were in search. I would never say that we did physical theater in a particular style because I am not alone and I learned everything on the job. Okay, you're not trained in theater per se. You did not receive any formal education. I used to only watch.
1659566372.0-1659576350.0
All of us have watched Kaplan, we watch Laura and at the same time I have watched lot of Sungi theater in Miranda.
1659578770.0-1659597506.0
I have seen Tamasha think about the folk theater. Not only is contemporary theater. Yeah. And so my theater had a lot of mythology. But in today's time I used to approach.
1659597698.0-1659652040.0
And the styling I still remember for Kasturi music was by Vishal Varadwais and he is a friend and he used to like my foot and he said we were all actually searching 97, 98 I guess he had not yet made a film. He was a music he was a known music composer and he took out time he heard my script and then he wrote lyrics, rekha sang, his wife he composed and he sent the obviously to take money from me. He composed it everything, like a professional. He sent me music pieces. And we were fortunate to have talent who wanted to contribute to the madness which we were then part of.
1659653850.0-1659706130.0
Custodia happened. And so I'm just saying, at that time then there was a theater company which I was fond of. But I think the plus point about us was as a theater company, we were ready to watch plays of other theater companies, whether exude by Nadaraji, whether Tacoji's Ank or ifter Stalwarts were acting Rabbit Salvaji were directly then there was no more if he was performing he was performing some abstract theater work at the time. Yes. Then we had obviously, Gerald, which is wonderful.
1659706210.0-1659711290.0
And he had his antigenny, he had many places.
1659715650.0-1659748098.0
I was watching English theater and as Mr. Juci had seen him, his Gujarati theater. So you were exposed to I mean, do you feel that that is something that has changed now? At that time you talk about contemporaries as collaborators, and you were all watching each other's work and involved in each other's work. Do you think now the whole theater community and theatre itself has evolved in a way where everybody exists in their own little silos?
1659748194.0-1659763100.0
There is collaboration, but within perhaps smaller groups, where it is some sort of a closed community. Do you think that has happened or do you think theater has sort of seamlessly evolved from the time you started?
1659767070.0-1659814462.0
Then also it was not easy that you be part of another theater company because their loyalties, but the opportunities let's go back to the era where Mobile, the access was very clear that if I'm meeting Prachi, I'm meeting meeting three other people, then on the same day. Yeah, so we had so much time, so we could really give time, dedicate our time. And so that dedication created bond. Now people is very difficult. Everybody is working and so people have less time span, forget attention, but even physical time they don't have.
1659814596.0-1659839860.0
So how do you expect them to be with one theater company? And in spite of that, I was fortunate that actors have really been with me and for several years, not only actors, I have this music director, Shalindra Bharva, and Swapping is no more, but Shalindra Burwei giving music for over 20 years.
1659842070.0-1659879614.0
A music director to give music over 20 years, award winner. Now in films, he does a lot of films, but even now, if he has to, he does music. And one of the finest tracks I have. So there have been people who have been in fact, I know Butter is 96, she's part of Balakkar now. She's part of joke.
1659879662.0-1659923086.0
She was part of Kabita Bhaga. Now she's been part of it and she believes in it. I don't think I suffered that problem of loyalty right. People really came and I'm saying like all departments now for the last I don't know exactly how many years but I have this amok for you does lights for me. And he's there for several years again now.
1659923108.0-1659975822.0
He's created his own assistance and he joined me when he was new. He had come as one of the when I didn't have somebody as the light person. He was there and now he's taken over. Then I have another director, Rajita she's a young girl who's composing music systems well. And I remember two incidences were amazing that I was doing this show of Ikanama Gay and this international violinist was traveling from Carolina to France and she had stayed overnight in Mumbai and she happened to come to PRITZI Theater and I was rehearsing and I had a show next day.
1659975876.0-1659997350.0
And I said I knew her Kasha, that she was part of her Romeo Juliet which had performed at three festival and traveling theater company foot spawn. And I loved her playing. She was amazing. So I said, are you there tomorrow? So she said yes.
1659997420.0-1660013766.0
And I said I have a play tomorrow. Would you play? And she said, but I won't understand your language. I said it doesn't matter and you will not believe in that. He used to look at me and I used to signal her and he used to play.
1660013808.0-1660040994.0
I told her what the subject is and I didn't have to even tell her. He felt the figure and it happened beyond language. That was one of those moments of my life I will never forget. And then there was this vivic, the breathing. There was a young boy who happened to come and I said, you play before the play.
1660041192.0-1660077470.0
But he played and he told you he met me yesterday. He's now himself a business director with a great percussionist. He said one of those experiences asked me to play and I play an audience sitting and I cannot as a young boy feel so exhilarated that's what was my or our working was always that you can't perform. Don't worry, don't worry.
1660083910.0-1660089400.0
Please tell we are here to listen to your story absolutely delightful about that.
1660091770.0-1660119482.0
We are a theater company which is more than 55 60 productions. And I'm talking about original theater. So imagine how many incidents we would have. But anyway so one of it is very important is that we had this tivariji no more. He's been since 19 78, 79 onwards.
1660119546.0-1660175150.0
He was with to become nutrition. And the other thing was that when he saw the first household board and he had told me he a household.
1660180630.0-1660196150.0
And the third thing when I did I remember trilogy is a very important thing which I should talk about. And then he said audience.
1660205610.0-1660234338.0
And then he was one person who would really allow me to rehearse anytime. If he broke any rule was for me at night I would sneak in every. Year. And once he used to come on his bicycle and one day he was looking for his bicycle and couldn't find it. And I asked him, okay, just come inside.
1660234504.0-1660277330.0
And his bicycle was hanging upside down on stage because he had and he was part of angel and he just looked at it and he thought now and we said, okay, we give you Rickshaw Bada. Now we have shows do not believe we could have easily got another cycle. Okay, but next time onwards used to only say became Tvariji's cycle. In our play there are many incidents that's really beautiful. I just want to take a moment.
1660277400.0-1660280690.0
There are a lot of questions coming in from the audience.
1660282710.0-1660283700.0
What's that?
1660296410.0-1660325840.0
There are questions coming in from the audience. So I just wanted to sort of bring those up to there are a lot of compliments, of course. But there's one particular question, which is actually two questions which says as someone who is so experienced in theater and acting on stage, when you go on a film set and there is somebody else directing you to do a scene a certain way. And, you know, it might be better out of your own experience in another way. How do you deal with that?
1660326230.0-1660333090.0
Key difference of opinion, especially set for methodology.
1660342650.0-1660376978.0
Largely what happens is that I am of a believe that everyone can make their own film. So you have to choose. If you have chosen the director, then you have to go with his vision. But what I do is I understand what he wants to do and I start performing. And if the director has enough peace, then he watches us also and he lets us do.
1660377144.0-1660427038.0
But I must tell you another interesting incident about this is I was part of a project where the director himself was not only an actor, but what do you say, heavyweight actor and heavyweight personality who would definitely pressurize the director himself as an actor. And when directing, imagine what we learn. You must also see the sequence his father and son talking. You can see one short sequence. And that was the other way around where I was searching for him prior before the shoot.
1660427214.0-1660445346.0
And I couldn't find him. And at night I tried to find the cabin Devodayudda's home. And he opened the door and I said debut's wife opened the door Sharami. And I said Is Nana here? And Nana came here's.
1660445378.0-1660456214.0
What? I said we are shooting tomorrow and we haven't rehearsed. And he said that is why I've caught you. I know you'll do well. And I was so upset with him because I was a person who wanted rehearsals.
1660456262.0-1660474320.0
What rehearsals? Long sequence. And I remember before he could come on the set and with his assistant, I saw it and I had blocked it myself altogether. Entire scene was blocked came and I said I've blocked my scene. Now you watch.
1660475250.0-1660489390.0
Very good. But I'm the director can you just let me do some changes? And he was so nice. You'll not believe I mean, he just said, okay, now can we do this? Can we do one shot?
1660489470.0-1660519310.0
And there's this lovely actor scene, actor Chutoda. And I remember his father son, you must see the scene and where Nana is there nana comes with madhuri and they come and Madhuri in the madhuri was about to say something happened to I still remember telling her that we know, don't say anything. It's father son's scene. It's their scene. And they were quiet, and they exit quiet.
1660520610.0-1660557306.0
So what happens is that there is one director in me. I wouldn't say no, I take over where I feel that director is not giving me time. Okay? I want time, and I like to but largely, of course, I listen to in fact, this new television OTT web show is coming surued on 15 July, where director Kanish was my assistant. So it was so interesting.
1660557408.0-1660568894.0
Now he's directing me and, you know, he's now a big shot director. And it's so nice. I was just so happy. And he would just say, sir, you just see if it is right. And I would say no.
1660569012.0-1660599430.0
I will get to it. That how I make it right. It is not about sometimes I feel director he's also trying out he's not full proof, trying to put belief in it to make it believable and fit into his vision rather than creating his own factor. You have to follow the director's vision. There's another person in the audience who is asking a very simple question.
1660599580.0-1660622240.0
How do you handle criticism? And that's something I'm sure you've dealt with from your early days on, and somebody who's broken the mold. How do you handle criticism? It's very difficult, of course. I still remember there was a critique written by I just felt that he didn't understand the place.
1660625490.0-1660652890.0
And I said, what are you talking we read that. What are you talking? I was just so upset that people are not sometimes when you see that critique are not well worth with theatre as media and playwriting, and you just feel that. And I was young, I was so angry. I remember I don't want to take the name of the publication, but I went and met the editor.
1660653550.0-1660654700.0
What is this?
1660657710.0-1660679810.0
I'm just upset. Do they know what they're doing? Because we work really hard at least to send people who are from theater. You can send people who are not well, worse with theater as a medium. And then it is difficult because how do you have somebody well worse with theater than somebody well versed with cinema?
1660680150.0-1660707686.0
It's very difficult. I understand. Okay, that is still okay, because eventually people are talking about it, writing about it. This is good enough. But the criticism within years of fraternity, nobody, they love you, they look up to you.
1660707788.0-1660787490.0
This, that, but no, you're if you really want to know your criticism. You just ask somebody, send your person and you understand criticism very differently. Used to come to me, the seniors come to me and would say that the problem was then Hindi theater was about you take Marathi place and then you translate them and perform or Jaywandalvi Tendulkar Sahar take their place. And you didn't do it. A person came somewhere from no background and you started original writing.
1660791530.0-1660849238.0
And especially from 2000 onwards, 2001, when I did Search, that was the game changer for group in a sense of that was one play. I decided that audience should understand everything. And when that play happened genuinely audience was again Sunali Kulkarni, Plates, Rajinder Guptaji, who was a senior actor, cleats Professor Palikar and Paneedar was one of the important characters were played by Anurakh Kashmir, and then there was Keisha, played by Abhimanyushing. Now, that play happened in 2001. And that really everybody thought that this is a play.
1660849404.0-1660868000.0
I mean, everybody saw it. All the filmmakers saw it then whether it take the names to everybody think that has a different history.
1660874130.0-1660878660.0
I wrote part two also in 2005 and then we performed together.
1660880950.0-1660892230.0
Then we decided to write part Three. And then Monday in 2006, we did nine. And in fact, when we did it in Paul.
1660895050.0-1660896920.0
But your voice is.
1660914690.0-1660933282.0
Performed in Delhi part One and part two. And this is Saturday part one. Again, people said that how would the audience come? I do not believe the same audience came. Have you ever heard that a set of audience come, say whatever, 400 people come on one day.
1660933416.0-1660951400.0
And the CM audience came on the party also that Anurag's Ponch was stalled to the sensors. And he was so angry. And I told him, do you want to keep him?
1660970130.0-1660997560.0
I don't know whether it is your writing or is it anura exacting, but I haven't seen a character like this over 17 years or many years. Something really was so penetrating and that play kept on. In fact, part two happened when his gulal was stalled and part three happened. When Black Friday was every time he had to be installed, he came.
1660999610.0-1661042760.0
That play has a great histories because of one more thing. And then the actors graduated and they became themselves professors and we had to stop the play in between. And then one of the audience told me that and she went once I was in Cafe in 2010 and she came up to and she said, I saw your saddle. And at the time when I had problems in my life or I had questions in my life and I found answers through that plate and why have you stopped it? I said, no, because the students, she said, you should revive, there must be.
1661044010.0-1661101758.0
And then Kunal Kapur had also asked me that can you revive sir for a family? And I revived with who will play on character? And I said, and ahana, Punra would play and there was and I decided because I used to play then also and when it got revived you'll not believe it's still running for whatever trend for years. In fact we've got this inquiry for a show in Delhi. So it's just that play which is people say then that play I did it in Gujarati with Prattiq Gandhi and that is going to happen in Namdabad now again revived postcam whatever his wife is unbelievable.
1661101874.0-1661132130.0
And then I did it in Marathi where I played Marati. I found a jackamre to be ANRA's character's character and I found Athrangardi to be the lead. And there was the new team performed in Marati as well. Then somebody has already transferred in Bengali also. So let's see where all will it go.
1661132200.0-1661142040.0
But audience says that anyway.
1661146170.0-1661165066.0
Yes, I'm not going to take too much time. I just want to ask you there's a question which is something I've also been meaning to ask. I know you have a play upcoming at Pritzfeed this month. So I want to know what else are you working on? What new work are we going to see you in?
1661165168.0-1661178926.0
And while you do that, do tell us about the new play Balakka. Please stop it. I know it's a play that's very different from what you have done. So tell us what your new work is going to be and about this place. New work?
1661179108.0-1661213946.0
You mean both where I can be seen. I told you that we will be releasing on Hot Star. So please all of you watch it. And then on 18 August, Dougreechild two those who have seen part one I've played daddy that will be releasing and then there is a Liger on 22nd August there's a special appearance. All those films will keep coming.
1661214128.0-1661273166.0
Part theatre. I have this 1213 July very important play which I feel again a theatrical presentation of something which is difficult after people the premiere shows have happened and people just Baladkar Nam rakhata in fact even Censors didn't want me to keep because I added please stop it. And when people saw the plea, people said just remove the peas and that's also important. And in fact and she said just remove the peas. And the best thing she said, she said all the actors she just loved it.
1661273188.0-1661315046.0
And she just said a play which is so good, very important play and told with theatrical language. So understand that theatrical language concept because it doesn't become preachy. Because the subject is as I say, the audience comes with okay, it is about Balakar as a topic. But what happens balakkar is a subject, we just to talk about it. It's about a theater company decided to play on Women's Day which is 8 March on a subject and we talk about women empowerment.
1661315158.0-1661326740.0
But what happens about the abuse which he has to go through around the year and which is an attack for being the woman does she have to pay?
1661329350.0-1661341010.0
Is that woman means her innocence? Or Komal Thai is becoming Kangoor. And how do we look at it as a dominant society?
1661344330.0-1661364380.0
So the theater company, the actors, what happens to them when you're working on something like that? How does that impact on them and how the real case they look into it and how they are performing and then what happens to them and how that subject goes inside them. It is no more news.
1661368510.0-1661385220.0
And so becoming a play, such a stark subject also is laced with humor. And humor comes out of disappointment. It doesn't come out of something happy happening.
1661387510.0-1661415310.0
And the actors in this have done really a lot of hard work. Yeah. You had mentioned in an earlier conversation we had that this was difficult, was a very difficult rehearsal space for the actors. It was a difficult process for the actor sitting there. And I always allow audience to come in so they go through their own experiences.
1661416050.0-1661448406.0
How that painful? So they really worked hard. Many rehearsals and I've got some outstanding cost and ensemble. But still I always say nivedita but for a period of time with me and she reads it. But I must say, there are many actors in the play whom you should watch it.
1661448428.0-1661450470.0
It's a cast of eleven actors.
1661453070.0-1661466060.0
The filmmakers would want to cast all of them. The theater people, the audience would love it and just come and you can interact with them. There are four shows. 12Th and 13th. That's pretty, right?
1661466610.0-1661479360.0
Yes. And on the 14th I have Ram. Now, Ram is a play where I'm acting also in that place. And Nagi Houston along with me. Again, the whole team is acting in that.
1661480450.0-1661508010.0
One of our iconic productions in the last few years. Yes, it is. I'm telling you, Ram is something which the emotion of Ram you will feel the Ram lila in this, who will feel the bhakti in this and you will feel the truth in it. Come. What sharam.
1661508910.0-1661532266.0
Yes, I think with that we are not going to hold you up any longer. For everybody else there's Balaskar on twelve, 13th, Ram on 14th and we will also see you on Hotstar on the 8 July, right? Which should we thank you so much, MUKhan. This has been such a beautiful conversation. So much to learn, so many memories you recounted.
1661532378.0-1661542550.0
As always, such a delight to have a conversation with you. Happy to be on full care. Thanks. Macron. Thank you so much and we hope to have you soon again.
1661542700.0-1661545490.0
Yes, thank you. Bye.

So hello and welcome to another episode of India Inc. On Colcate. Today we are going to be talking about India's goal to achieve net carbon emissions by 2070. We are also going to be talking about how India as a developing nation can reduce its reliance on fossil fuel consumption while also increasing production and usage of clean electricity. We will also to take a look at how a transition to a circular economy can become essential for both public and private sectors as India doubles down on its climate commitments.
1656550146.0-1656570000.0
For our conversation today, we have with us shipya Shiva. And from Karu Samha shriepiya is the Strategic Alliances and Partnerships Manager with Karu Samha, which works with organizations and individuals transitioning to a circular economy. Hi Sharpia, welcome to the platform. Hi ANC. Thank you so much for inviting us.
1656570450.0-1656584450.0
Thank you. We also have with us Aditya Lola. He's a senior Policy analyst with Emboss Climate, which is a global think tank that aims to reduce coal consumption and promote clean electricity. Hi, Aditya. Welcome to Cookie.
1656584950.0-1656597400.0
Thank you, Andy. Glad to be here. I'm happy to talk on the topic. Okay, so if you are all ready, let's jump into some questions. Yes.
1656598090.0-1656629620.0
So Adika, I'd like to start off with you and the first thing that comes to my mind when I'm talking about the 2070 climate goal is that it's set 20 years later than most other countries target. Europe, for example, finland, Austria, Germany and some other European countries are targeting 2045 or earlier. And most other countries, including US, UK, New Zealand, South Africa and Afghanistan are targets for 2050. So do you think India's 2070 target is set too late to make a change?
1656632470.0-1656680462.0
It's actually a difficult question to answer, but short answer to that would be that not necessarily the reason I say that is because it doesn't matter when we reach what matters is how we reach the pathway. And the journey, as cliche as it might sound, is what is more important. Why do I say that? It's because when we talk about net zero, the concept of net zero in the broader spectrum of climate change, where does it sit? It is important because science has basically said that we need to limit our global warming to less than 1.5 degrees by the year 2100 in order to make sure that there are not any repairable damages done to the ecosystems.
1656680606.0-1656731070.0
And what that means is that we have a very limited carbon budget. Carbon budget means the amount of emissions that we are allowed to emit till the year total thousand 100. So if we have any net zero target be 20 50, 20, 60, 20, 17, they won't mean anything unless they come with a pathway towards achieving that. Even if we have a 2050 target and if we end up like, you know, ramping up like, you know, fossil generation, which which will increase overall emissions in the next few years, then we'll eat up into the total carbon budget. And I think, and this is not just for India, I think for any country, what matters is that what we do now, which will kind of set us on to a pathway to net zero, whatever the dynamic.
1656731750.0-1656767574.0
More specifically for India, what is important is how India's pathway fits with the overall 1.5 degree target that we have set for us. So that's my slightly longish answer to that. Yes. So before India made the climate commitments in November last year, we back up a few months. In March last year, the Indian government said in a press note that the need of the R is a development model that leads to the optimalization of resources, emphasizing the need to transition from a linear to a circular economy.
1656767702.0-1656778080.0
After its latest climate commitments in November, how important has it become to shift to a circular economy in the both private and public sector? If she fear, do you want to take it?
1656780690.0-1656797720.0
So I like to kind of blend a little bit on both sides of those questions that you ask for this. One thing that I would like to just clarify, probably simplify, is when you say net zero, what does it really mean?
1656799930.0-1656814554.0
We are allowed the amount of carbon emissions we make. It's not to offset. It is like you're putting something out in the market. You're trying to absorb that much from the market. Right.
1656814672.0-1656826474.0
So is it the real solution? Probably no, because what does it mean? It means that you keep emitting. You keep emitting. You keep emitting outside and absorb Carthage or Sequester furthage.
1656826522.0-1656845700.0
I mean, that is a simplistic way to understand that. And if you have the permitting, where are you going to dig out the resources to create that energy to keep emitting carbon emissions? It comes from somewhere. Energy has to come from somewhere. Now, when we speak of circularity, think about it in this way.
1656847450.0-1656875406.0
Everything around you today, just look around in your room, any component around you, it is a byproduct of the oil and gas industry. I would guarantee that 80% of it is a byproduct of the oil and gas industry. My laptop with your phones that I'm talking to you on, also every component that comes here. So we are heavily dependent on a particular industry and we need to accept that first. Yes, it is the case.
1656875588.0-1656907574.0
Now, we also need to understand certain resources are being mined so Earth can under be whatever resources are there. It has a limit, and it has a limit to how much man can actually dig down and get those resources out. Right now, since industrialization has begun, we have mined enough already. And now that is, I imagine, slowly it's going to get expensive. Mining is going to get expensive, right?
1656907612.0-1656932830.0
Because we have to go to difficult places, difficult areas, and dig down deep to get those things. There are more than half of your periodic table is present in each electronic he limits. People know the forms. So now if you just look at it, see how much of resources is already on the surface of the Earth today. Something that has taken thousands and billions of years to form under the Earth's surface.
1656932990.0-1656952870.0
Now that we anyways have it on the surface, where do we have it? In the landfill. Because we are used to a good, we are good consumers. So we try to buy things and replace things every year, every two years. So on an individual level, kitna consumption have career.
1656953930.0-1656984658.0
So if this is the phone, I purchased it two years back, it came from somewhere, I'm going to throw it somewhere and the day I'm done using it, I'm going to give it away. I'm really thinking where is it going? So for now, to give a brief technologies, economic technologies have scaled up to a level. A lot of the resources are going to the landfill. And now a simple understanding is, well, the assembly of the phone might have a life of two years.
1656984744.0-1657017934.0
Example I'm just giving, but the components within it have a longer life. So that itself becomes an urban mining. So what circularity that even the world is trying to achieve is they're trying to do the urban mining. So whatever components are present right now on the surface of the Earth, potentially in the landfill or probably in somewhere in some kind of a film, right, of that particular component, they're trying to extract the resources from those. But extraction is easier said than done because it needs that kind of a technology.
1657018132.0-1657035406.0
So when you speak of the goat like India has aimed for 2017. So do we really have economic technologies to extract those to become circular? Probably not. We are not there yet. We are still struggling with recycling technologies.
1657035518.0-1657077120.0
So imagine when you talk about circularity, so much of work needs to be done and this needs a global action. To me, net zero country wise, yes, it has socioeconomic impact, but it is actually a global target because we are heavily dependent on the world to run our everyday lives today, right from your anaj to your technology, there is so much of lost linkage from different countries. So that is how dependent we are. So no matter whether countries take up the target, it is actually the world's target to go circular and net zero, only then can we achieve it. Only then can we truly lead a sustainable rate.
1657078370.0-1657115386.0
I would like to end with that. So you're saying it's not about one particular industry sector or a country getting into a circular economy. It has to be one of the world goals. Otherwise there's no point to one country becoming circular economy. And just to follow up on that, the question that I was asking that do you think there should be like a timeline to this along with the climate commitments like transitioning into circular economy is not one of the primary climate commitments that India has made or is working towards right now.
1657115568.0-1657128000.0
So do you think it has to be it has to come in one of the primary commitments for it to actually be actionable? At some point, yes. Okay.
1657130930.0-1657153666.0
If you want this, one pathway would be simple change. A lot of transitions have happened in the country. Your white revolution or green revolution. Everything started with rules, right? So India, maybe now, if you look at it, there are EPR regulations that are coming, and it is fully expanding to different components.
1657153778.0-1657169170.0
So one eva Kagara put it in. Now, people are aware that evasive is a separate type of waste, which I should not be putting in my dry waste, right? Initially, people used to mix everything. So even electronics. Today, a lot of people put it in dry waste.
1657169190.0-1657211450.0
So although the policy is different so what ETR policy stands for is Polluter Paints, who become the polluter. It's the manufacturer of those components, manufacturer and producers of those components. So what these rules essentially say is the amount of components that you release into the market. As the manufacturer and producer of that component, you are supposed to take back that much amount of waste that can be derived from electronics, not essentially your own product. So such kind of rules have come into picture, and it has been on since in talks from 2010, 2011, and now it got implemented in 2016 with multiple amendments that have come with me.
1657211600.0-1657234754.0
Now, because of these policies, these policies automatically generate newer kind of businesses. Also, you need to be aware that whatever new comes in by a certain kind of businesses go out of business. There are new forms of enablers in the economy. So now what has come into strength is, for example, what Karl Sambhav does is setting up collection systems. Now, think about it.
1657234792.0-1657247430.0
Producers and manufacturers have got their own strength. What is it building? Fantastic poles, fantastic laptops. Thinner it is, the better it is. A lot of these technologies are coming now for them.
1657247500.0-1657277438.0
It is possible that they might not have an expertise in waste management. Categorically, you have to imagine at a company level, on the board level, you have to actually create that team together. So there is a different kind of agencies who help you set up those collection systems across, say, for example, across India collection system set up here. Now, just having a collection set up is not enough because you have to back it up with awareness. If people don't know why this is open, why would they even come to you to give it?
1657277524.0-1657312150.0
Right. Examples of policy release policy, but we figure out who are the people who are actually going to implement this policy on the ground. And it reaches right from policymakers to rack pickers these pickers because they are the ones who are actually going into the landfill and it is like a daily wage activity for them. So that is how the chain is connected. And if a country is releasing policy, usually it doesn't happen, but if they are doing it without considering all the players, it is impossible to create that transition.
1657312310.0-1657336114.0
So this is the linkage it comes. And when you say timelines, it is as humans who actually make it slow. I don't know if everyone would agree to it, but it is about the resistancy of Boba. While the system can be implemented immediately, imagine when you stop something, it is the socioeconomic impact that has on the market. Right?
1657336152.0-1657380194.0
So it has its own transition and that's why it takes years to actually truly transform. But I would hate adequate. Yeah, I think should be a very eloquent to kind of outline how the perception of uncircular economy is domestically here. But as Amber, who is an international think tank working with some of the people involved in coffee negotiations, I can say for the fact that circular economy is actually gaining relevance and gaining more importance in negotiation. It was not so a few years back, but there is an increased cognizance, especially on solar pants and recycling material after the end of the life.
1657380312.0-1657420334.0
So because of that, there is increased focus there. An Indian government is also now starting to think about it and Indian government has already I know for a fact that within a few ministries there are committees looking at circular economy policies and things, which is what Shapir was kind of alluding to, I guess. So I just want to add that. So one solution that we are seeing is transitioning to a circular economy. That puts us on the path to 2070 is another still remains is to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel energies and also to restrict it right there, not to increase it.
1657420372.0-1657458822.0
I mean, India as a developing nation is still heavily reliant on coal. And if I'm not wrong, it's about 60% to 70% of our grid electricity that comes from burning coal. In the last ten years, between 2009 to 2018, it shot about 60% up because the country puts towards and visualization the coal users shot up 60%. So what are the immediate steps to restrict fossil fuel consumption that we should be focusing on? And how do we keep the balance between focusing on growing industrialization and also abiding by the climate goals and restricting fossil fuel moves?
1657458966.0-1657480174.0
Yeah, yeah, I'll take that if you don't mind. So, yeah, you're right. I think India's electricity sector is very heavily reliant on coal. And the numbers from last financial year actually shows that it's around 73%. Actually 73% of India's electricity comes from coal.
1657480222.0-1657495554.0
And India is a developing country. India has development needs. And the bottom line is that India's development in the short term is very much linked to like, you know, burning coal. There is no two ways about it. So what needs to happen?
1657495592.0-1657525466.0
See, first of all, if you want to make sure that the coal generation peaks or even plateaus and then goes down, what needs to happen is that you need an alternative source which will allow us to do that. At the end of the day, none of us would want any power cuts, right? So everybody wants the power on, but the reality is that we are dependent on that. But having said that, it is not all doom and gloom because India has very ambitious renewable energy targets in the short term and also in the long run. So India currently has a 175 gigawatt target.
1657525498.0-1657546386.0
It's another issue that India is slightly behind the curve on its own targets. But I think the first thing that needs to happen for us to plateau or peak coal generation is to make sure that you have an alternate source of cleaner energy. So that's the first step. Second side is the coal set. Because India is heavily reliant on coal.
1657546418.0-1657556102.0
There is there are many legacy issues. And what do I mean by that? There are a lot of power plants. There are a lot of jobs associated with there are a lot of mining jobs. There are lot of power plant jobs.
1657556166.0-1657581538.0
So there needs to be a systematic way in which you address challenges associated with those things. When you ramp down, it's not just a case of ramping down cosmetic. It's also making sure that everybody in the ecosystem also is given with tools necessary to actually follow that pathway. That's the second aspect. And the final aspect is the ecosystem itself.
1657581624.0-1657605698.0
So, what I mean by ecosystem is that you need to have a power system which is compatible to the variable nature of renewables. That's a technical challenge. And then you have the financial side of the thing. So right now, the finances few years, I see a question in audience interaction that coal is inexpensive. It was inexpensive five years back, but now things are changing, especially like solar and wind.
1657605724.0-1657626270.0
They are one of the cheapest tariffs in the world is in India, and it is much cheaper than coal at the moment. New coal plants is what I'm referring to. At the same time, with battery storage. Battery storage costs are also expected to come down by 2025. So there is technological viability there, there is financial viability there, and that is driving the transition currently.
1657626420.0-1657662650.0
And I think one of the first steps that needs to happen is that in the short so we we have, like, you know, three different sets of challenges. Short term challenges, mid term challenges, and long term challenges, all under the purview of energy security. Because, again, remember, India is a developing country. So to do that, the first thing that needs to happen is that India basically gets as close as possible to its targets or renewable sites and then find mechanisms to actually reduce the coal generation and then finally, like make sure that it builds an ecosystem which kind of supports this transition. These are the three things that needs to happen, in my opinion.
1657665570.0-1657704920.0
Just following up on that, you're saying coal was inexpensive and now obviously that's changing. And solar and wind power compared to coal is going to be cheaper in the future. For example, setting up an offshore wind turbine is still more expensive than setting up an onshore wind turbine, which in turn is related to a lot of land related issues and there's a lot of pushback from the people who own the land to put up in turbine stairs. So how do we go about that? I mean, it is still more difficult to be producing offshore wind turbine energy.
1657705450.0-1657719510.0
Absolutely. So there are three things, I think, whichever address in your question. The first thing is on wind and solar cost. Just to clarify, they're already cheaper than coal. So if you like, you know, add battery cost to it, it is expensive.
1657719590.0-1657737794.0
But but I think battery plus wind and solar is going to be cheaper than coal made this decade, around 20, 25, 23. That's what the numerous studies actually say. So that's the first part. Second part, with respect to offshore wind, yes, it is expensive in India. So a simple answer to that is that we don't go for offshore wind.
1657737832.0-1657765126.0
We go for an option which is easier for us and which is inexpensive for us, and that is solar. So we have solar and onshore wind, which are cheaper. So there are options, technological options out there and they are also becoming financially well. Now that brings us to the third point, which is the policy and political side of the thing, where how do you get the buy in from the people? How do you get people to install solar panels on the rooftop?
1657765158.0-1657809734.0
And especially rooftop solar panels has been equally received in the last few years. So I think that is where I think a bit of proactive measures will be needed in India, because we are a federal system where you have a central policy and then you have states having their own policy and priorities. I think the political compatibility is sometimes not there and that is what has been missing. And in my view, the way we overcome this is through market dynamics, the movement, your electricity becomes cheaper, I think everything kind of falls into place and that is kind of what's happening as well. And with respect to land related issues, those are the issues which we need to overcome.
1657809782.0-1657837186.0
I mean, there is no way about it. Government needs to find ways. Government can take inspiration from some of the other countries, like, say, like from Vietnam, or look at countries like the UK even, and where this was such a big problem ten years back. But now I think it managed to find ways to incentivize people to use the Navy so I think that these are all different cogs of the whole wheel. But I think there are options out.
1657837208.0-1657879630.0
There for people to consider, particularly in solar and wind and any other renewable energy that way. We have seen a lot of new startups coming up, a lot of VC funding going that way. Ashi Prayer did you see the same thing in any startup that's working with circular economy, transition investor interests in that. There is now because the world is talking about the term circular economy, it is solely dealing recognition. But look at it, even for renewables, the reason we have 17 SDGs is because sustainability cannot be achieved keeping everything separate.
1657881010.0-1657910762.0
So I'm just trying to make a link now, even in renewables, imagine 20 years from now the solar panels, if the life of the solar panels 20 years soon going to misappl waste in 20 years, do we have that much space in the landfill to accommodate solar panels? Yet no winter bands move. And so circularity is about not recycling. Circularity is about designing in a way that there is no waste. Right?
1657910896.0-1657948130.0
If today we invest in designing in a way that whatever, even in the transition to renewables, whatever components we are using to create that energy, extract that energy from nature, if that does not become a waste 20 years from now, we are already saving ourselves the carbon footprint for 20 years from now. Right? That is the way to think in circularity. And this when people get investors start understanding oh, it's a better investment for future and slowly it is coming up. But if we just look at it from cost perspective, right, I see the lotsma is really energetic in sharing questions about expenses.
1657948290.0-1657969178.0
So when the if we just merely look at today the only benchmark for sustainable businesses is unsustainable businesses. Look at it for investors, what is the benchmark that is it. So for them to understand this business model, it is counterintuitive. It is really hard for them. It took a lot of time to get that.
1657969264.0-1657989246.0
So today if you see a lot of impact, investors are there in this. The reason why banks have come on board is I mean that's like a chicken neck story. People have started demanding so banks are the ones that give them money. You see ESG funds coming out slowly, slowly there is a transition, but it just can't happen. That investor comes on a table.
1657989358.0-1658011850.0
When the investor comes to invest to make it big, it comes with economies of steel. So I see that a lot of questions have come up like batteries are expensive. Coal isn't expensive. I'll just keep it short, but I'll keep it if you just pick up food pool is not inexpensive. Look at the exploitation that goes behind in getting the coal out.
1658012000.0-1658022014.0
The human cause actually yes, how can we say it is inexpensive? People have lost their lives to bring this thing out. Right? So that is the cost. People have lost their land.
1658022052.0-1658063942.0
I know roads falling down because it is all mined under and this is prevalent in East India a lot. So it is not inexpensive. If you just look at the money maybe it is not really inexpensive that way it's renewable. They're actually coming up with better ways of working, better standards of working now the same if I apply to any circular design. So that is where we have to think the socioeconomic agreham starts with we have to start thinking from that perspective and yes, investors will come on board but today there are very few but because now the policies have demanded brands.
1658064086.0-1658079220.0
So see, one simple thing we need to understand is we cannot be vigilant is to make the world sustainable. We have to take the big brands together because they are running big columns. They have employed billions of people across the world.
1658081270.0-1658121534.0
We can't just say hey, stop buying from them, take them. Because now policies have even banks have started questioning, the shareholders have started questioning what are you doing to create a better think about even the branch? It's just an engine manufacturing company, unka engineers. So they have to start thinking how can it sustain their business after 20 years? So it is a complete mesh where brands also have started thinking my resources for my products itself will end if I don't act upon it now.
1658121732.0-1658150920.0
So that is the way what is needed today is the pitch for circularity, pitch for sustainability which is definitely lacking because this holistic way of approaching investors is lacking today's market. And that is why, I mean, see you have to ultimately make a pitch like why do sharp times exist? Because you have to convince people to come on board which is the next big thing. So that is we need to make sustainability a little bit more cooler for people to stand.
1658154970.0-1658189698.0
Sorry, I think really interesting points which repria touched upon and I think I thought I'd just add a couple of things from the economics actually talked about the social cost of coal on the economics front, just to give you a sense of what is happening. India currently has around 30 gigawatts of coal plants under construction. Not a single coal plant is financed by private sector. Everything is being funded by government. The private sector investment has completely dried out in India and I think everybody accepts that and it has been a trend in the last five years.
1658189784.0-1658231726.0
On the other hand, on the flip side, I saw that just the other day that 86% of India's 500 gigawatt target by 2030 I think 86 of it has already been committed to by the private sector. So you can clearly see the mood of the big brands which EPA was actually talking about and it is actually towards renewable because they see the profitability, the profit equations. There more than import and that's the case even everywhere else in the world. Coal's generation in the last year it kind of had a little bit of search, but that's due to like an economic rebound. Post the pandemic.
1658231758.0-1658266918.0
But I think, again, what's happening right now is that there is an increased push towards the renewables and India is actually trying to be in the front of the boat, so to speak, especially driven by private sector. Just so I'll add that yes. And I think a lot of them have a question that renewables are very location specific. Do you think it's the case? Because if I think about setting up solar electricity for, say, a particular complex system where it doesn't have to acquire a land first to do that, that is for bigger projects.
1658267014.0-1658278400.0
Setting up solar electricity could also happen on your rooftop or on your garden or in a very small area as well. So do you think it's still very location specific to set up renewable energy?
1658280530.0-1658291390.0
Well, see, that's the thing about renewable energy. You have options. I'd argue that coal is also location specific. We can't set up a coal plant right next to our home. Delhi is struggling.
1658291470.0-1658324394.0
Delhi had a problem with pollution because of the thermal plant, and now there are no coal plants in it around. Or at least there is a push to kind of shut down those coal plants. So even every coal, every power plant has these challenges. And yes, there are like when you talk about utility scale solar, there are issues around land acquisition and stuff, but that's more a political problem and that is what we kind of elect our leaders to solve. So this is a policy challenge and we need to and nobody's saying that going through renewables is without challenges.
1658324442.0-1658351318.0
It has its own set of challenges. But at the end of the day, we still need to look at what is best for India, india's energy security, and at the end of the day, how we can make sure that India fits with the overall broader 1.5 degree target, because otherwise we won't have a world to kind of look after. And in terms of technology being location specific, yes, that is true. But that is where your battery systems come into play. That is where your green hydrogen comes into play.
1658351404.0-1658365722.0
That is why we need flexibility. We need to build that flexibility within the system. And these are the challenges that India needs to tackle head on in the next few years. And India is trying to do that, actually. So India is trying to position itself as a leader in green hydrogen.
1658365786.0-1658384418.0
India is trying to build more flexibility. Just the news from yesterday says that India had some tender with solar plus battery for the first time in Gujarat. So India is looking at options. And this is a clear sign that India is also pivoting. But at the same time, India needs to make sure that the.
1658384424.0-1658413686.0
Lights are on in the short term midterm. And that is why we still need to kind of make sure that we have coal plants running in the short term at least. I have any particular question about green hydrogen, and we have been I mean, it's pretty new to be talking about this a few years before nobody was talking about it. And when do you think we see a lot of new projects coming up around green hydrogen and investor interest? Big investors are already saying Adani is already investing in green hydrogen production.
1658413798.0-1658426560.0
So when do you think we will get to see a scale in its production and see green hydrogen enter commercial use? And are there any barriers that are stopping this from happening right now or is it a matter of just time?
1658428690.0-1658449362.0
I can take that. Green hydrogen is a nascent technology. So it's something which, like, especially in India, it started gaining relevance in the last couple of years. But it has a huge potential. And Indian government, rightly, so like, has identified its potential and is trying to kind of develop it into an industry.
1658449506.0-1658480146.0
Isn't at a scale where it is mass applicable? No, absolutely not. It is at least ten years away from being commercially viable. But then again, for it to be viable commercially in ten years and work needs to start now. Because, for example, if you look at another carbon sequestration technology in CCS, which is what a lot of fossil fuel fossil fuel groups talk about, it has been around since last 1015 years.
1658480168.0-1658499206.0
But right now, it has not moved beyond pilot space. The technology itself hasn't taken off. But having said that thing with technologies is that the growth is never linear. It's always a step change. So five years back, nobody thought India would have the amount of solar capacity it has right now, but eventually it did.
1658499228.0-1658523134.0
So the goal or eventual hope for people working in the green hydrogen industry is that the necessary R and D that needs to take place, takes place. And eventually it comes to a point where it becomes financially viable and then the markets will come and take over and then you'll again see a step change and out of the way. You would see hydrogen becoming a bigger solution. Will it be a success story? We do not know.
1658523172.0-1658544578.0
Only time can tell. But at the end of the day, I think this is one of the better options that we are. Especially if you look at industry sector, because industry sector is a hard to abate sector and I think that is where it has a huge potential role to play. I'm talking about green hydrogen. I mean, same with green hydrogen.
1658544594.0-1658590740.0
And both the CCS technology we served in the concept of circular economy, it's been around for some time, but work on it hasn't been starting on a larger scale. So, ship, if you want to take this one, when do you see this gaining traction in the Indian market? Like you said, the brands, like people don't want to be associated with brands that exploit fossil fuels and is not sustainably conscious that way that is coming in as consumers slowly. We don't want to be associated with brands like that. So when do you think this sort of consciousness is going to come among the consumers that okay, we want to be associated with brands that do work with the economy and at least investing in it, thinking about it, making policies about it in the private sector I'm seeing here.
1658595610.0-1658640462.0
So that association that it is saying, while heavy way to start saying no to brands who are not following sustainable practices, but that change will come with quality. So when it comes to, like I mentioned earlier, bigger brands run the country, right? I think we all agree to that because you're employing a lot of so let's understand the socioeconomic impacts of that. So now when policies come in, like how EPR has come in, the policies have asked the brands to take charge of the waste that are coming. So that is what circularity is.
1658640536.0-1658665342.0
The first step to circularity is to start having your collection systems in a way where you are having that segregated streets. We have been for everything. Now I would give it as an exercise for whoever is in this call. Just look around in your house and truly look at it. Whatever type.
1658665396.0-1658684082.0
If you can put everything in a bin today, would you really put all the dryways together? No. Metals go separate, glass go separate, textiles go separate. The boost, we are able to segregate it properly. We are able to take it to the next level.
1658684216.0-1658726394.0
So what is misunderstood with circularity in most cases is the recycling. People think it is recycling, which is misinformation because if you just say recycling, milky bowl, banana, it is down cycle while it would be a part of recycling. But what circularity really means is if you are dismantling a phone, every component of that phone has a new life. It has formed a part of probably a watch or laptop or something. So in a way it is continuously circulating and you don't have to mine virgin resources.
1658726522.0-1658756790.0
That is what it essentially means. Other good transition kiwi Anna Hair a lot is happening. India is seriously working towards circularity, or rather the world is working because without that we cannot live. We cannot live the life that we are leading today, even in the next decade, because we are going to be short of Virgin Ring space. But what is happening is the socioeconomic factors make it a little tough for the transition to happen fast.
1658756940.0-1658787614.0
Now even for example, Kara Samba's collection centers, which are there in areas where we are linked to the informal sector, a lot of ways are to be regulated within the informal sector. So what does it mean when we say informal. So they don't have GSC registration. They're not recognized as a business. While they might be doing a lot of business and selling and trading base but the sophisticated technologies that are now coming earlier it was a little easy because they could identify actually a glasses.
1658787662.0-1658802358.0
This can move, melt. This is a plastic property. It can melt and it can work. But today there are complex items coming in the market that are coming and going as waste. How do you explain a watch to somebody who is probably taking it from a base they don't know?
1658802444.0-1658819920.0
They would just break it. Break it and cherry pick things that comes out of it. And this bakkika do what they could see a value. Even metals, they would only know gold and silver. What about the remaining metals which have actually been mined from underdeveloped nations and the properties of it?
1658820850.0-1658849590.0
They lack that information. But informal sector is really working in base industry. I remember one of the key challenges initially when Carson was even launched in 2017 was to get the informal sector on board because they had to be told. That why certain practices that they are doing with this mantle of the PBAs is toxic for the entire community over there because it led to burning. Their whole way of extracting that was just burning kids doing those activities.
1658850010.0-1658878830.0
Imagine they are probably dealing like one lag per day is the kind of transaction that's happening. But who is working because you have no I mean the whole community is engaged in just burning and breaking things so that they don't know how to extract value out of such ways. So that is the beginning because this whole circularity would come. Only you and I, each one of us at the grassroots level are involved in participating in that awareness, taking people on board. Let's do this.
1658878980.0-1658908010.0
That is where the starting step would come. It is hard if we just wait for the government to act upon it. If we just wait for the brands to act upon it, it is difficult because each one of us is equally involved in everything around us. So we have to take the lead on creating that awareness and spreading that awareness while we have to nudge the brands and the policy makers to do something right now which can enable this transition. That is my stance because I feel it's an all actors approach.
1658909070.0-1658930910.0
Definitely it's going to bring a change in our own lifestyles as well. And that sort of brings me to the next question is as we transition to a low carbon economy and as our goal is to transition to a low carbon economy goes closer to 2070, what sort of changes will we see in our lifestyle and job and agriculture and food pattern as consumers?
1658932930.0-1658958650.0
Other things you want to take it. Or should we have? Yes, a massive change. I think what we are saying by that is especially in Indian context which has been heavily reliant on coal power when we have been very much addicted to using it in a very inefficient way. It means that we have to fundamentally change the way we think.
1658958720.0-1659010570.0
And you've kind of touched upon what it means in different parts of the economy, lifestyle, jobs that we consider in consumption. So all of them I think will everything from managing your supply chain to the highest level of providing your power, I think everything kind of needs to be restructured and I'm talking about it from a long term lens. In the short term, obviously we are in a bit of a transition period and that transition is kind of happening at a speed which is happening. But in the long run I think like CPA was also alluding to, I think a lot of awareness needs to happen. A lot of bile needs to come in from the policy and politics.
1659011470.0-1659041070.0
At the same time bin needs to come more importantly from the people and I think that is where I think that is going to be a challenge. As we move, maybe CPIA can add a bit more. I wanted to just add an example of how it would look like. Just imagine we are all in an airplane and then we are announced you are now going to live in that airplane. 50 people who are there in this airplane.
1659041150.0-1659050918.0
We have to manage our lives now. Think about it. How are you going to approach life? You have to live in that airplane. So you'll find a way in.
1659050924.0-1659077066.0
That airplane has to run on it can land for refueling, petrol or vitamins which is there. So we will innovate. Innovate that we can sustain without killing ourselves in this type. So what stops us from really looking at us like a spaceship? The Earth, which is a spaceship, has limited forces and it's time we start thinking of the ways to survive.
1659077178.0-1659090820.0
The more we narrow it down, the more suffocation we realize oh my God, it's in an airplane. I'm stuck in an airplane. What do I do? It's just that earth is so big we think it's forever. Life will drastically change when we start thinking from a different place.
1659091350.0-1659109626.0
Yeah, just to add, I think I think we should never underestimate our own ability to adapt. Just think about how we were 20 years back. There was no internet. We don't even know how to even know that something like this would be possible to interact with each other on video. But here we are and we have adapted to it.
1659109648.0-1659132180.0
And I think one thing which we have seen as a humankind in the last two decades is that we have this immense ability to adapt, to change and I think that is what is going to happen. And Pandemic was also one such example. Life has changed like in the last two years, right? The whole economy has grown up around remote walking and pandemic related. Exactly.
1659132630.0-1659140100.0
And especially international diplomacy. They see the pandemic as a dress rehearsal for the bigger pipe, which is climate change.
1659142150.0-1659164570.0
And again, like CPA said, the bigger brands of the world, not just India. I think they've already like they started embracing that. And I think the world is kind of moving towards that, whether we like it or not. And ten years down the line, it won't even be a debate whether we should actually burn more coal because there will be increased pressure from international spheres on India. India also doesn't want to be in that situation.
1659164640.0-1659188500.0
India wants to be a leader and India wants to champion this growth story around clean power. So India is also moving there and we will adapt. And we are almost at the end of our time. And it brings me to my last and the most important question is that on our current path and plan, do you think it is going to be possible for India to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070?
1659193530.0-1659221134.0
Yeah, I can go first. So right now we do have a target, which is that we need to be net zero by 2070, but we don't really have a plan. I think it will take a bit of time to actually figure out what it means and how we are going to be. And just to give you a little bit of a backdrop on how this plan came about, it was mainly because there was international pressure on India. There was a growing clamor at Cork 26 that India commits to net zero.
1659221172.0-1659237666.0
And India was like, okay, we will satisfy everybody in India now is a 2070, which is a good start. I mean, I'm not begrudging that. And I think that it opens up space to actually have conversations around how we can reach it. There has to be a definite timeline at some point. Exactly.
1659237848.0-1659247800.0
So is it possible? Yes, anything is possible. Again, like I said, ten years back, nobody thought India would have this level of solar and wind capacity. Here.
1659250810.0-1659263270.0
I was also going to address what Dilothama just asked. She's asking about whether other countries have viable plans to achieve net zero. No. Many net zero targets of 2050, even they do not have an immediate pathway. And that's the challenge.
1659263350.0-1659286066.0
That's the next step that we need to push the garments across the world to come up with. And I think, again, with the examples that I've just talked about, everything is possible. And I feel I have a feeling that in the next decade or next two decades, there will be technological spurt. And because of that, you'll see a step growth. And I think India will hit carbon neutrality much before 2070.
1659286168.0-1659306354.0
At this moment, it seems like a smaller target. But I think with the technology maturing and the finances and the market aligning, I think it will happen and it has to happen. There is no other way for us to kind of survive as human kind. Of thing is ending. It on a very positive note, that and I hope we do achieve it before 2017.
1659306402.0-1659321280.0
As a result, that 20 years later than the other countries. And we'll also have to wait and see. When do the other countries come up with their own plans and definite pathways to achieve their own targets for, say, 2050 or 2045? Shipper. Do you want to add anything on that?
1659322130.0-1659354806.0
Yes, I really like how this is business coins in fact that made me think he what is lacking today is climate leadership. People nominated leadership which is needed so if we have to take the ship in one direction, constant direction one thing is for us to keep monitoring the targets we have to start reading and at times old school methods work the best. You set targets, you achieve it, you have a monitoring system. Did it what went well? What didn't go well?
1659354908.0-1659385726.0
Change the process and start working across. Right now we are creating policies and everything is good but then it comes to a country level reporting we don't have a climate leader climate leader was supposed to be advising the prime minister of the president. It's just the advisors who are the consultants who are there. So while we have now we have tourism and environment as a joint thing, right? But slowly we need to bifurcate and have teams.
1659385758.0-1659408326.0
Even within that PPIO has like a twelve community thing for serving their economy, which is great, it's a think tank. But slowly we need to have that even in companies. Maybe you're working for an It company or mechanical company or some other startup. Start asking your company what are you doing for climate? What are we doing, where are we?
1659408428.0-1659434430.0
You know many a times even in institute I have attended certain webinars and I was invited to talk about climate change by I am poor and two more other colleges and there while you are talking circular economy you'll be surprised to know they don't have basic waste management in their own facility. It's just about Palestine.
1659438390.0-1659449990.0
We all can take it together. It's us. We are the next leader. How many of us are politically inclined today? I mean I'm not talking about political tires and fighting on Twitter.
1659450570.0-1659469514.0
If you see an issue in your area are you willing to step up even volunteer to create a change in your space? We have that leadership within us or within our community. If you can't do it, do you know someone who can? Probably we can create those small shifts. We can be leaders of the NGOs.
1659469562.0-1659486494.0
We can be leaders country kill levels of fortunately influences the chair. Yeah so if the country has said Ki 2017 at January why are we considering we are not a part of the country. We are a part of the country. We are the ones who are supposed to be asking, hey, what happened? Can you share reports?
1659486542.0-1659514342.0
Can you please make data transfer into what has been done? Transparency plays a big role in achieving targets because unless you actually pay and people can actually monitor sahima who are hacking. So that is where the journey begins and that is where each one of us have to play a role. We think it's hard time to preach what we are practicing or reading or propagating. So thank you so much for your time.
1659514476.0-1659537518.0
I'm it was wonderful having a conversation with both of you and it was really informative for me and the viewers, I'm sure. And I hope to see you back on the platform soon for another conversation. Thank you so much, I see, for having this. I enjoyed the conversation and hopefully I'll be more than happy to come around again and have a family. Thank you so much.
1659537604.0-1659538490.0
Thank you. Bye.

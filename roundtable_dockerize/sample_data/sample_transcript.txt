1658205410.0-1658210662.0
Yes, I can see you. Can you see me and hear me? Yeah, I can see and hear you. Great. Great.
1658210796.0-1658236194.0
So hello and welcome. We are here on another episode of Curtain Call on Cool. And we have with us today Folsey Jalali, who's an award winning playwright, actor, and director and who's recently directed a play called Strictly Unconventional, which is a series of short plays on modern unconventional relationships. So welcome, Foise. It's lovely to have you.
1658236232.0-1658247960.0
I've been wanting to have you on the show for a really long time. Oh, thank you, Brad. Great to be here. Great. So I'm going to first start off with like we do with most people.
1658248970.0-1658261500.0
Where did your journey in theater start? You've been doing theater for a really long time and across the board, from devised pieces to writing on your own. So where and when did theater start for you?
1658264430.0-1658284640.0
I hope to say in the cradle. But actually when I was very young with my sisters, because we like to just play, so we make up stories and then take my mom's clothes and grannies sarees and all that and just do stuff.
1658287830.0-1658304550.0
We didn't really need an audience. We do it for, like, family and all, so but we do it for ourselves. Just like acting and making up stories and performing them and stuff like that. It was quite like from a young age, of course, my sisters are all scientists.
1658307710.0-1658329802.0
Remained with you. Yeah, so I stayed in it. And I was lucky enough to go to a school where theater was really encouraged. And I just sort of answered some questions on another article. Actually, our school principal of JB Pettis High School was very encouraging of the arts.
1658329946.0-1658347654.0
And she particularly every year we do one big play. That for padami. I guess the newer generation of actors won't know, but my generation, I guess, would know of to be a school director. And she was also exceptional. Right.
1658347692.0-1658382900.0
And my school principal was, of course, feminist. And all of her plates used to write most of them. And the protagonist used to always be a woman part of that. So it's so weird because I realized this much later in my life, and as you understand more, she was the feminist of her time. He was really making all of us that creating for women, about women, by women.
1658383510.0-1658423360.0
So it was really amazing because it struck me quite late in my life that, yeah, all of a school played it was a female protagonist. Right. So my school had a big, big role to play. And, you know, it was really important now, when I think about it, that she instilled in us this joy of creation, of actually being uninhibited speaking, and not only just speaking for entertainment, really revolutionary, you know what I mean? Like women who really were game to India, in a sense.
1658425010.0-1658445750.0
So I'm getting goosebumps just talking about it because it means a lot to me now in my life, that she was such a strong influence. And from then, of course, I went to St Radios for my 11th and 12th, and of course, big there. And at that point, I thought I wanted to do dentistry.
1658452650.0-1658473706.0
Even now, at 43, I'm not sure what I want to do in my life. So at 1718, of course you can't expect someone to know how they want their lives. Of course, there were lots of people who knew exactly what they wanted to do, but I was like, I really wanted to do physics. I wanted to do dentistry. I did not want to give up here to went into dental school here in India.
1658473738.0-1658501894.0
I'd have to actually stop everything else. So then my sister had gone to a liberal arts college in the States, and I also was like, okay, cool. Even I wasn't even very well thought or anything. I just followed my and I went to this liberal art school primarily to do theater as a degree, but alongside to do premed. Because in America, in your undergrad, you do premed, so that once you undergrad, then you can go to tender school.
1658502092.0-1658522560.0
So I thought, okay, side by side, I'll do it and all that. But I think by my second year, it was very clear to me that and I'd come back during the holidays and watched my theatre here, and I was like, I want theater my way. I want to do this. So I think at that point, it was very clear to me that I wanted to focus on acting and directing. Of course, at that point I was like, I'm never going to direct.
1658524930.0-1658537890.0
Too much work. I was focused more on acting. But then I still did my directing degree because it was just an additional degree. And of course, at that point, people are like, oh, theater, you do theatre. What else?
1658537960.0-1658539300.0
Because it's not good enough.
1658542790.0-1658562538.0
You're doing that in the evening. Yeah, it is me off guard, because I feel like but what else? Am I kind of seeing that? But I don't think I'm going to really pursue that or whatever. I used to do a lot of then I did track and feel and of course doing the college plays as well.
1658562624.0-1658583040.0
And from there, after my fourth year in undergrad, because in America, it's four years of undergrad, I applied for grad school in my last year, and I got in immediately, which was again amazing, because there were a lot of my seniors in theater who hadn't gotten grad school. And so I felt it a little bit like.
1658585190.0-1658616842.0
Early on. Sorry, I feel like you made it early on. Yeah, but it was also very strange because I remember my theatre teacher in college, Rod Omelas, he told me he's a poison. You've applied to three or four colleges, which were like, of course, NYU in Columbia and all of those he said, but if you see any open auditions, any colleges that have open slots, just sign up for them. Okay, cool.
1658616976.0-1658624800.0
So I had to go from below it to Chicago, and it was a big hotel, and I'm like this what am I going to do?
1658627730.0-1658640562.0
Literally, I was feeling lost. But anyway, I went for my normal auditions, and then I was walking around, I saw a few open slots. I went and signed my name. And then there was one slot. I'm looking at it.
1658640616.0-1658657286.0
It's at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I'm like, who's going to go to Knoxville, Tennessee, of all places and all that. It was the last slot, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, Should I, should I not? And then my professor's voice literally was ringing, sign up. And I signed my name.
1658657308.0-1658697238.0
Literally, as I finished putting Foise, this girl came out and she said, oh, are all the slots taken? And I was like, yeah, that was the last one. And it's amazing because I made it to that college, and that was one of the few colleges that had a full scholarship for the three year program. So if you get into that college, which only takes ten people every three years, you get a full scholarship and be happier. Because I was like, if I go to any college that has my dad having to pay another, I'm not going to be, because at that point, I was feeling responsible and horrible about so much money.
1658697404.0-1658712570.0
So I was really happy, actually, because it was kind of one of those things that happened. And from then there I did my Masters, and then I came back, I did Tim Suppose mid summer nightstream.
1658714590.0-1658756806.0
I was doing a couple of reihan's plays. A lot of things then just happened, and it just became more and more about theater and doing theater. So whether it was directing for schools, teaching drama, performing, I think theater was where I kept going. And of course, over the years, I've done a lot of film and TV and Footwear series, but I think theater is my heart, and I just have my hands in the pockets of the film so that they can give me money so I can do it. Theater, I think it's as simple as that for me.
1658756988.0-1658793314.0
But you you never considered, like, a full fledged career in film. That was never something that you wanted to do. Maybe I did for like, 12 seconds, but I see pratti also. The thing is, there are lots of realities that hit you. And one of the realities is that acting is not an easy job in that sense, because a lot of times people are like, why do you simply need too much money?
1658793352.0-1658840500.0
Level. Sure, it's mismanaged, but they also do a lot of hard work. But the point for me is, I realized quite soon that I will not like the typical face or whatever you're always the bubbly friend or the whatever, the crazy person colleague or boss or whatever. So I think maybe earlier I had wanted something, but then I realized also quite quickly that that's not how things work. And also, from doing sales, I realized that it kind of doesn't satisfy me the way doing theater, most of the time you're waiting as an actor, you don't have much control over a lot of things.
1658841670.0-1658883700.0
You take apart. Yeah, you're just another part of the machine. But in theater, it's like as an actor, it is the actor's medium, in a sense, where you bring so much to it. Like, as a director, also I rely on the actors that I cast because I feel like they bring in so much. And so whereas in film, I feel like, first of all, there are so many parts to that scene coming together, and I feel like the people who are really good at it, they should do it.
1658884550.0-1658900950.0
I'm good at doing theater. I understand that world, you know, intimately understand this film, like so I think for me, a lot of these realizations about whether I want to do film or not, even now, when people are like, why don't you direct a film?
1658903610.0-1658945780.0
I don't know. It's like telling a bharat natyam dancer, can I go and do some tap dancing? It's all dance, but it's very different. So for me, it's like the joys that I get from doing theater, the actual interaction with people that of course, not to say that in film you don't, but film, there's so many paths that are always trying to come together. And I have so much admiration for people who do films because it won crazy nightmare for me to just coordinate, like six, seven people to come into a rehearsal room for three months.
1658948090.0-1658988078.0
There are hundreds of people involved in a film, so I have great respect for it. I don't know I'm talking about currently, I don't think it's my medium, so to speak, unless suddenly something in my brain slips and I never thought I'd direct or write or produce, but things evolve, so maybe but I think people who are good at films should be doing it. And I am good at doing theater, so I'll continue to do theater, and I don't feel like the thing is that people think it's an evolution that you have to grow from one medium to another. And I think bullshit. Because that's rubbish.
1658988174.0-1659007254.0
Because how are you saying that TV, film and all are better mediums so that I have to grow out into that? That's kind of bad, because it's the same. It's like theater. Actors are using theater as a stepping from sure, if they want to, they can. But acting is different.
1659007372.0-1659040900.0
But as a maker film, I don't think that theater is on the bottom rung of the ladder of various entertainment platforms. I think it's on a different ladder itself, by virtue of the fact that it can't be a digital platform. So I think this problem of, like, thinking of growth and growing and don't you want to do something? No. For me, it's more about being able to do more productions, having more people do theater, be able to pay them.
1659043990.0-1659047430.0
That's my dream is to have theater be able to sustain.
1659049770.0-1659077840.0
Right now, it's not right. Right now I included, and all my actors and everybody who works with me are all relying on something else, like TV. And also we have great respect, please keep casting us. But the thing is that whenever theater can be self sustaining, that for me, would be a huge achievement. Because in itself, it's not a stepping stone to a bigger platform.
1659078610.0-1659096454.0
Theater theater is a very different medium. And you can't expect a filmmaker to say, okay, now I'm downgrading myself and doing theater, or a theater director to say I'm upgrading myself and doing stuff. That's a big question. Of course, the finances, if you are talking financially. Yeah, that's what it is.
1659096492.0-1659124800.0
Also, it is a product of the fact that we live in a city with such a large film industry and invariably everything connects up there. Yeah. So the next thing I wanted to get to, I want to know about some of your early productions and I also want to know when did you start writing? You've mentioned direction and acting early on as well. Did you always see yourself writing your own place or when did that start happening?
1659129650.0-1659159850.0
So, again, writing was something as a 7th grader, I remember writing, diary. Diary. I'm in love with discourse. I have a crush on that girl or whatever in school. So I used to write quite a lot, which is sort of like stream of consciousness and writing or to write to complain or whatever.
1659159920.0-1659167450.0
But I think in 2013, what happened was that I had a breakup.
1659169650.0-1659191940.0
Wait, sorry, just to go back in 2010, I was in this, like, workshop in Germany. It was a dance and movement workshop. And I wanted to work on a couple of things there. So part of the workshop was that you come there with something to work on. And she Sundi was as was all in the timing, which was another piece that I did.
1659192710.0-1659237514.0
And because I always wanted to look at things physically, I started with Chihandi and I made in that workshop, I made it a 20 minutes, one moment show. So I kind of devised it there and I'd written it out in terms of just like, what I'm doing stage work in 2013. So between 2010 and 2013, I was like, I should write this, I should write this. But I wasn't really doing it. And then I had a heartbreak and suddenly I was writing a poetry and I revisited Shifundi.
1659237642.0-1659267786.0
And I started in December of 2013. Sorry, january of 2014, I went to the UK again to do like a three month movement and space course at risk. And there at that time, the Royal Court was having this International Writers Competition and I was like, oh, great, I'm going to submit Shikandi for this. And I wrote it haphazardly and all 25 pages. Then I submitted it.
1659267808.0-1659299106.0
I was saying I have to finish it. So at least I thought to myself, I met some deadline. It was a 25 page poem verse about Shifundi. And I submitted it based on the 20 minutes piece that I had done and of course wasn't chosen or anything like that because it was rubbish in the sense it was badly formatted, nothing, because I used to write on the train and all that. I said, Just put you instead of who I owe you, I put you punctuation marks.
1659299138.0-1659359306.0
And I just submitted it. Obviously it wasn't really reflected very well on me, but I then started working on that more and more and then I started fleshing it out a lot more. And I think in another interview I also mentioned that I really enjoy writing in verse because I think it kind of encapsulates ideas for me and feelings, and then I can go back to them and sort of flesh them out better and longer or nicer or whatever. But then just having it written in verse helps me and I think because I don't know, I think my sense of humor is also such that I go into rhine because I play with the rhyme as well, make words that don't try and rhyme and stuff like that. So it's a very playful medium for me.
1659359328.0-1659401414.0
And I think because I was emotionally in such a tough space that somehow this was a really good outlet and I was expressing a lot of my own ideas and all more articulately than I thought for me was that that's where it actually started, actually writing, writing a play. Then when people read it and they liked it first, I think, how am I sharing this with anybody? It must be really hard. Maybe I only think it's nice. But I shared it slowly, slowly, and people kind of liked it.
1659401452.0-1659419050.0
And then I was like, okay, maybe I can do this. Then I submitted it for Sultan. Padam SIA was one of the runner up. So then when people start appreciating, then you're like, okay, maybe I can write. Because I never considered myself a writer.
1659419130.0-1659432240.0
I think always, even in school when you have to write compositions and all that. Mine was very not bad, but very like in that satkawa crazy kind of way.
1659434790.0-1659458966.0
I don't know. So some of the very articulate writers used to write really well in my classmates. Mine was more likely Maza and all of that. But I think that sense of humor or dry humor, whatever it is, that kind of got a mode of expression in some ways. And so since then I realized that, okay, maybe I'm not the greatest writer.
1659458998.0-1659505800.0
But I can write and I can write about things that I feel affected by or things that I feel strongly about. And because humor is a great tool for me, I can express using that as well. So then, I mean, she Candy happened, but before that, seven, seven, seven happened. But again, that was the device piece, which took a little bit of I think in that sense, my sense of editing is also good, of how to put a story together. And seven, seven, seven, even the actors came together and we first created the scenes and then we wrote them.
1659506910.0-1659551766.0
So that was the opposite way of doing it. And then after that, of course, there was Bone of Contention, the strictly unconventional. And yeah, so I think, like and I mean, over the pandemic, I wrote a few more, which I hope I can produce in the next couple of years, at least. Again, they're all fun, but they all mean something to me because I feel very strongly about certain things about religion, for example, about women, about queer people. So those things are themes, if you like to call it.
1659551788.0-1659574014.0
But those are things that my mile kind of goes to. I don't really think about it so much, but something will come up and then it'd be really based on religious bone of Contention. It is about how have you seen Bone of Contention? I haven't, but it'll be great if you can tell us more. I do know, but for everybody else's benefit, I would really love to.
1659574212.0-1659600070.0
You telling us about how Bone of Contention came to be. It's a really interesting piece. I thought so. Bone of Contention in Cosmopolitan Cooperative Housing Society is a title of the three, which everybody hates me for. But the idea was that a crow drops a bone in the balcony of a vegetarian household.
1659601130.0-1659636420.0
And of course, in that cosmopolitan housing society, nobody wants to take the picture so that that family throws it into another family's house. So it goes from the Hindus house to the Christian house to the par three house to the Muslim house. Really stereotypes. It's a complete fast. And the only person who touches the born is the DD who works at all four houses because, of course, only she is allowed to touch it because everybody else is to clean.
1659637590.0-1659662860.0
She's the dirty one, so it's okay. She touches it because it's a fast. There's nothing hidden. Everybody thinking that the woman was thrown by a crew. Everybody knows what's happening, but we are looking, watching the character and also perhaps facing prejudices and prejudices of people around us.
1659663950.0-1659670030.0
The DD herself, when she talks to the audience, she's a sutra, she speaks in rap.
1659673410.0-1659723290.0
She's a Marathi actress. Amazing. And there was a Marathi rapper, poet Sujaya Jade, who had translated my English stuff to Marati and put it in proper rap first. And it all came together really well because I think people on every level totally identified with those characters because they are mad and their prejudices are right on the surface, not even native. So again, even in that the Parsley couple is an asexual female couple, okay, the Christian girl and the Muslim young girl are having an affair.
1659724530.0-1659765450.0
It has queer themes, it has themes about religion and prejudice, it has the basic theme about classism and this thing that we are always called cosmopolitan housing society. But it's obviously a joke on that. Nobody means nobody is like that. And I also had each of the family structures nontraditional, even though everybody believes they are holding on to tradition. The Jain family, the Hindu Jain family is three men, three generations and the grandfather, his son and his grandson.
1659766110.0-1659794360.0
The Christian family is a divorced woman and her two children. The Parsi family is an asexual couple with a dog and the Muslim family is husband, wife and daughter. But of course the wife is sort of the matriarch of the family. So for me it was all like, okay, we're talking about families, but the structures are all and it's all three and that's kind of breaking the north, the four families were in three.
1659798090.0-1659844614.0
It was a really fun show also, just that it's such a big cast bring everybody back together. But Conor's contention was another thing, and that stems from when I was much younger. I lived in house, in a bungalow and over time there was a gen colony that came up next to it because where we were staying. So we were a Muslim family and a partsi family, purely knowledge, like sharing a wall. And of course, when we acknowledge there would be perhaps a bone dropped in the Jen colony, which actually wasn't there before, like when I was growing up.
1659844732.0-1659917050.0
It had recently come up and they had a temple and stuff like that, so it actually became a border, so nobody would say anything. But it was just like all those pastries over there, that thing kind of stayed in my head. And I was like, well, it's an amazing story, and most of my stories are from real situation. Even in strictly unconventional, all stories are taken like the core of the ideas taken from real stories, from people I know or situations that seen or actually witnessed or been part of or read about and then of course I fictionalized it, but the true seed of it is in the core of real life. So even bone of contention, it's a very real situation, it happens, I have a problem, but I just think it's really funny that what if this small little incident would blow up two crazy proportions?
1659921810.0-1659960342.0
It can actually lead to a riot, you know what I mean? But if you can look at it in the classical sense, you can actually probably see the politics of it better without feeling preached to or attacked by when you can just sit there and be like, oh my God, that guy is like, that guy in my building. There's a certain viralistic pleasure that you can derive out of that. Sure. Because you don't know how many people came out of the show and say, this is exactly what happens in our building meetings.
1659960406.0-1659990900.0
This is exactly what happened. And with one auntie was like, yeah, this lady keeps throwing chapatis down. She keeps throwing this is why Prachi for me, it was so important to come back from the States. Also realize that, yeah, we've been doing a lot of British playwrights and American playwright. Amazing.
1659991350.0-1660015706.0
But we have such crazy, real particular stories that you would never have outside of this. How many housing societies like this would you see outside of? We have ramped for space. We are in each other's ompits. Of course you're going to have like even at home you have fights with parents and stuff like that.
1660015728.0-1660050680.0
But when you're in a community with people, such different belief systems living together. I mean, of course it's full of politics, it's full of prejudices, it's full of humor and it's full of humanity, like human beings and what we're living with. So I just find very interesting that our society has so many stories. We have so many stories. Why are we going, okay, Shakespeare is great and you know, but it's done now, you know what I mean?
1660052170.0-1660069850.0
Whatever. Like Bernard show. I love all of this and I studied it a lot. But I remember that when I was in my master's program, I had a Russian teacher and he told me we had to do something about Lady Make, that we had to make up something. And I did something.
1660069920.0-1660083630.0
I did some of my jazz training. And this training is like for Indie, you come from two rich cultures, indian, use your culture.
1660087830.0-1660115162.0
It really stunned me and changed me and opened me to like, oh my goodness, yes. I have not thought about that. And suddenly from that point, something swift. And then I came back to India after seven years. I was really determined to understand, learn and be able to practice some Indian form.
1660115216.0-1660151910.0
So actually in the last couple of years now, I have been training in Colorado. Kudiatum also is something that I saw. You had mentioned, kudyatam. It's a form that is so fine that I just cannot stop admiring it. I know I cannot do what Kapila Vinuji Suraj all my teachers do, but when I got introduced to it in 2017, my mind was bobbled.
1660152330.0-1660172206.0
I was like, how are we not promoting this form for about over 2000 years? It's it's not new. It's one of our oldest forms. And like I'm telling you, I didn't even know about it. And if somebody had told me to watch Podia Term, I'd have just been I'm sure I would have watched it, which I did.
1660172388.0-1660190260.0
When Tim Couple was here, he was supposed to do Peter Pan after midsome and nightstream. So I was helping him with auditions. We had gone to Kerala in Jalapura. The couple have performed for us for like an hour, and I sat there watching and thinking, oh, my God, wow. But I had no idea.
1660190710.0-1660202662.0
And now I find it very important to understand it. I can't do it. I suck at it. I know I suck at it. And I was the one who begged couple.
1660202716.0-1660220490.0
I was a couple of please do some online sessions. So she started in class year every month for two weeks or something. So I'll do it. I suck at it. I can't chant those showcas properly, the way they use their voices, their eyes, their gestures.
1660220570.0-1660253218.0
And everybody in my class somehow is a dancer or just gets it. So I'm just like, what am I doing? But for me, it's just important that I am a little bit connected in some way to it, to just understand whatever. On a very basic level, I feel like I don't understand at all. Everybody else might ask me to just get it, but I have so much admiration for that form, and I can't even say I've done a workshop.
1660253314.0-1660273838.0
I mean, these practitioners have been doing that all their lives. For me to say that I've done any of it, I've just done workshops. But something about it is so powerful that I feel like, okay, maybe I will never be there. I won't. I know this.
1660273924.0-1660303762.0
I've come to that understanding, but I want to be able to just appreciate it. And even if learning that much of it is appreciation, then I want to do it. Calorie, on the other hand, I've been wanting to do for 15 years. Like, calorie for me is much more my thing. It's a very physical not that Kuriam isn't, but I'm more about the big gestures and movements, and so I can make them easier.
1660303906.0-1660359526.0
The fine details like Kuriatam requires you to tear me apart because I don't have a patience for it. But I think for me, the last 710 years has been a lot of forms and ideas and really understanding, oh, my God, there's so much. And what was I doing not to see that my education abroad wasn't good? What I really like in the Western form of education is how it was so flexible, and I could learn so much, and I learned a lot, and it opened my mind to things that I couldn't have imagined that I would learn, but also how they sort of literally make everything step by step. They formulate make a formula of things and teach you like this.
1660359708.0-1660373710.0
And then here you have in new forms where you have a guru just showing you and showing you, and you do, and you do, and you learn, and you keep learning from your own body. So it's not like you stand like this. Hold this hand. He's. Just showing you and you're following.
1660375250.0-1660401526.0
So I feel like learning, for me is such an important aspect of being a performer and a creator that it's something that I hope and wish that I will never stop. Because I even learned Malcolm for Midsummer Night's Dream. And somebody told me, Go and learn something. Go learn artery or go on. I'd be happy to.
1660401548.0-1660411340.0
I'd be like, yes. And that's what happened with Malcolm. I wanted to do it for so long. And then Tim was like, do you think he can go and learn Malcolm? I was like, yes.
1660412670.0-1660447106.0
And I didn't know where, what, how I just somehow figured out and midday only, there was this article about some Japanese girl who had comment on Malcolm. And I checked it out, I went there and I was like, So I want to do it. And I really put my heart and soul into that as well. So those are the things that I really appreciate. And again, when I was traveling with, I enrolled in circus schools so I could learn the silk and the western rope and the trapeze and all of that.
1660447208.0-1660456940.0
So those are like the circus is one other circus kids are another thing that I really think is amazing. And I want to do a surface show as well.
1660460270.0-1660462570.0
There's so many things I want to do. Brady.
1660466110.0-1660467260.0
I can tell.
1660469410.0-1660494630.0
I realized that you have trained in so many physical forms and you have devised work. So how does that play into your work? I'm also trying to understand, do you write in work because that somehow sort of feeds into deviced work? Or how do you select a play when there is work that you have to device or like you said, you work backwards.
1660497610.0-1660536334.0
No, so it depends. Like, if I had written something, then it's easier to suppose, like with the bone of contention that was the script. But still we had put people together and make them improvise certain scenes. Or even with Chikandi, we improvise a lot of the scenes and try to find different things and incorporated things. But for Shikandi, it was the first time that I was very clear that I wanted to use Pudyattam, Yakshukan and Kalari in the storytelling.
1660536382.0-1660580234.0
And what I had in my mind was that even though it's written in burst, the physical form of it would be like in the traditional dance form if I wanted the actors to have that. But my English first text, and it first was very hard. It was really hard to do all of that. The language of the body and the language you're speaking has to really and hence, when something in Sanskrit, in Malayalam or something storytelling is happening on Hindi even, we're able to animate so much more because it's in the body. But with English, it's much more like subtle.
1660580282.0-1660591060.0
And then you're doing all these things. We also have to find that balance. But when I write in verse. I think it's because rhythm is quite an important thing in my life.
1660594570.0-1660626400.0
But even when I'm writing scenes and stuff because as a writer, actually I act it in my head like I have those voices. So then there's some sort of rhythm that's created as well. So it often happens that in the worst the rhythm is there. But if it throws also if I'm writing it there is some sort of like something playing in my head. Even when you do Colory, for example, there's a rhythm working with the weapons, for example.
1660627090.0-1660652600.0
The whole thing with the weapons is also that they create a rhythm. You and your partner find that rhythm together. Somebody might be slower, somebody might be faster. So I think using these forms like I think the Indian forms have an innate sense of rhythm in it, right? And I think text also needs to have some sort of rhythm in it.
1660653130.0-1660683582.0
So I feel like in that sense, writing in verse helps the idea. And it's not very conscious or deliberate thought. It's just something that I think subconsciously I'm very close to ridden. Just ridden, you know what I mean? Even with the body, with movement, just anything that there's rhythm, I think most people would.
1660683636.0-1660694520.0
But you kind of latch on to it and then you create. So I think for me that is important because then on a subconscious level even an audience is responding to that.
1660697530.0-1660717690.0
They don't know also, perhaps. But I think part of why she funny people tend to come out of feeling joyous is that there's something rhythmically that also sits with them and in that when you break the rhythm, it's very annoying.
1660720590.0-1660732720.0
For example, if an actress has the wrong word because I know the play quite well if somebody says the wrong word or says an extra word or one word less then it's always for me.
1660734930.0-1660769214.0
Yeah, that's where I feel like the Indian forms have a lot of that because all of them work with rhythm. Like rhythm was with rhythm. Colory has an innate sense of rhythm because you're always going and it goes. It has a certain way of happening that of course, I guess, in some ways reflects in my writing. But even if I'm writing in pros I think in some level it's working for me.
1660769252.0-1660813960.0
Like some rhythm is there in my because if that rhythm is not there and then I read that part or I read a thing and it feels weird then I know I have done something because I don't have like a writer training or anything. I don't have the capacity of going technically into things and saying that. But on I have a capacity of understanding a lot of the world around me on a very intuitive, self level. So even my writing is very much like that. If someone commissions me to write something, I will do it.
1660814350.0-1660828080.0
But if I'm writing for myself I can because I can take as long as I want. And I'll have these pears of moments where I'm just writing, writing, writing in the rhythm. And then if I go back to that also, then I'll be like, oh, shit, how did I write that?
1660831330.0-1660870906.0
I don't know if it answers that. Question, but I sort of get it because that's the first thought that came to my mind when you said you sort of write in pros, and I know a lot of your work is devised. There seemed to be an inherent connect in that. But I do want to move on. Next to the themes, the one thing that struck me when I was actually watching Strictly Unconventional, was that even though these themes, the ones that you talk about, that you bring out in the place that you do, are invariably more common on screen, but hardly explored in theater, hardly explored on the stage.
1660871018.0-1660902310.0
And there are a lot of things that play out, as you had mentioned in your work, from themes of gender to caste to class. A lot of it is visible and a lot of it is sort of out there. And I just want to understand, is that something you do deliberately in the sense that you see there's a lack of these themes being represented on stage and which is why you are trying to write these? Or how do you pick these themes.
1660904330.0-1660951000.0
For strictly unconventional, primary the thing about gender or sexuality has always been very strong theme. So, like, also for me, a very important character because I'm like, I love the Mahabharat. I love it, I love the story. But to understand these small characters and why they're there, for me, Shikandi is like a representation of gender and sexuality that you wouldn't see otherwise. The Mahat is talking about really, like, strong men, heroic men.
1660951930.0-1660969360.0
Doing that person is fighting all the typical stuff. But there are these little glimpses of extraordinary human beings or sexuality or genders or characters that come.
1660973410.0-1660989780.0
That's the path that I really want to understand. So it's not deliberate, like, okay, now I want to talk about gender. I will write about you. For me, for me, I'm meeting the Mahabharas and I'm like Jesus. I didn't say Jesus, but okay, whatever.
1660990870.0-1661049830.0
God, there is this character who is so interesting on a very basic level. I have not read the very elaborate versions of the I've just read, like, the two part or three part, like those not like the smaller versions. Of course, I don't know the details, but from the version that I read, it was like a story that came and went. The boy character, she hung and has a sex change and is riding the chariot for Arjun, ajun is hiding behind. So, I mean, for me and it's like, that is interesting how the storyteller has made it possible for the most invincible person to be killed.
1661052810.0-1661071470.0
The storytellers found an obste way of going and seeing this person is neither woman normal or is both women and whatever is not like in the binary, and hence can be the reason that DHMA gets killed.
1661075090.0-1661094278.0
Even Narsimha, for example, stories that are just like, oh, you're so clever. So you created a character to come here is the most invincible person, right? So that is very interesting to me. So how are these characters? Where do they come from?
1661094364.0-1661139620.0
And somebody has thought about this. And a character who's either you call a gender fluid or non binary, whatever you call Shifundi, however we want to describe them in this context then existed that there is a character or a couple of characters. Even Arjun, when he was in exile, was a eunuch. So the question then is that there are storytellers telling these stories from way back when. And still, why is it such a big deal?
1661142470.0-1661169030.0
It's important for me then, not for me in the sense, not for me as me, but for me to say that okay, as a director, it is very important, deliberate, for me to say that I want to cast more women, I want to write more for women. Those are deliberate choices. That's why when Chikandi was played by a woman, that was malas. A lot of people are like, but why is it why is it a woman? I'm like, because she's a woman.
1661169190.0-1661185150.0
I want to be a woman. Why should it be a man? Women need that space. And theater is a space that you can do it. Because I know in friends, like, we're just playing whatever, sisters one darken or bitchy boss.
1661185490.0-1661213020.0
Yeah, it's actually like five things you can do. So you get into that and you say, okay, fine, I make my money from that. But on stage, I want to have women do more, say more, be more. And so that is one very deliberate thought. But the stories that I tell, because I'm very influenced by religion, and when I say influence, I mean, I actually mean I'm very interested in what religion does to people.
1661213870.0-1661244082.0
Like, what is it? What is it that religion is doing to people? And what have people understood from religion? Honestly, if somebody wrote a book and said, these are the rules, follow them and make your own life from it, maybe that was religion. But right now, we're in a time and space where those rules are being taken for what they mean on the surface, and that's it.
1661244216.0-1661263146.0
That is it. There is no thought into like, what, why, whatever. So we're then full of prejudice, hate, revenge for God knows what. I don't know. So I find it very interesting to bring it on page.
1661263328.0-1661273200.0
What are these prejudices? And like, in America, it's the race theme, the black and the white. And here, I think religion is that.
1661275650.0-1661288420.0
So is task and class. It's that thing that we know it's there we kind of talk about it. But we don't know, we don't address it per se.
1661290550.0-1661320270.0
It's like a weird thing, right? It's really weird. And I feel it's so hilarious for me actually, on many levels, what people say based out of religion, based out of this is our land and that is our land and this was this and that was that person. Oh my goodness. So for me, the fast of it is this true belief in my belief.
1661320770.0-1661381178.0
So I feel like religion and then gender and sexuality. Because again, in religious texts or not in text, religious belief systems, this whole gender and sexuality thing is such a big thing and it can be cured and you can do this. And we have whatever yoga poses for it and we have jelly booty and we have this. Again, that again ties with religion as in gender, sexuality and of course task in class. I feel a lot like I did a yoga course and what I took back from that course actually was how everything was written for the upper classes, upper car, and how everything if you don't do this, that is dirty.
1661381274.0-1661417542.0
If that is that, if you want to be clean, you should do this. Those and and how people who do not do that are like animals and this and that and how it's written from that mindset of the powerful to keep the non powerful in check. Not good enough if you don't do this that year. And so that is once again, I feel again, that brings in a little bit of religion or belief systems or whatever. Because I think at some point religion became about class in class and how to keep check by saying god is watching you're being watched.
1661417606.0-1661432420.0
You better be careful. And if you're a good person, you do this. You're a bad person, you do that if you were a bad person before, that's why you're living this life. You deserve it. It's all of these things that completely reduces human beings to nothing.
1661434470.0-1661490542.0
People stop being people to take away any autonomy. Yeah, so these things really are with me all the time. And the other thing that I'm very strongly for is environment and how that has again the politics of that around corporations and things like that. And again, I'm not in a play about the environment, but when I do my plays, I'm always conscious about recycling costumes, having things that are not using one time plastic, things like that, as much as possible, even strictly unconventional. We literally pull out clothes from everybody's wardrobes so that we're not making any of those financial make sense, but environmentally don't want to go and buy another bunch of clothes that are just going to sit around or going to dump my sex.
1661490606.0-1661533746.0
Like for Shikandi, Farming Story was recycled cardboard and we used some of that wood from Farming Story and strictly unconventional. So I think on that level, also it's very strong for me. I think your beliefs come in and I think because as a writer so whatever your beliefs are, I mean, I'm not saying anybody believes a right, correct, whatever or minor, but I'm just saying as a writer, you are reflecting the world that you perceive through your writing, through how I see my world. I would write about it that way and hope that something about that reaches you as an audience. Of course, I don't want to isolate you.
1661533768.0-1661551906.0
I don't want to make you feel like, oh, you don't know anything. So obviously I'm going to write so that my writing can reach. Otherwise, what am I? This just an intellectual exercise. So I think strictly unconventional.
1661551938.0-1661574110.0
The whole point was that what is unconventional? I think you've addressed a lot of aspects there from mental health and relationship. You've talked about polyamory. I felt like there was a lot of representation that was curious how much of that was actually deliberate and how. Much yes, a lot of it.
1661574180.0-1661611542.0
In terms of C, my thing deliberate in my head was that I don't want on stage only to see man woman coupling. Right. Visually. So in the polyamorous thing, even though he's gay and she's polyamorous, just seeing a hetero coupling, even though they're saying, but that is a representation. But having two women on stage, which really is important, having a trans couple on stage is important, even though, again, that was heteroparing.
1661611606.0-1661646680.0
But it was that they're both going through a transition and they are there. For me, it was very important that the visuals are not only male female, male, female, because I think we've seen a lot of that in couple stories constantly. Yeah. So I think that was one visual that was deliberate in my head, that it's not only that, it's beyond that. And the stories, of course, came about as they came about by talking to people or reading up something and then writing about it.
1661647290.0-1661685794.0
And of course, I have a list of unconventional as you go into it, you like most of what is unconventional about it. There's nothing really unconventional is really actually asking itself what is unconventional? And the people are like, oh, but that is a conventional story. I say, yeah, but that's fine because the thing is that you do see that even in an unconventional setting, there is very conventional things that are happening. In a very conventional setting, there might be rather unconventional things that are happening.
1661685912.0-1661718746.0
So then what is it? Because in a sense, every relationship is unique. So you cannot say that man man coupling is like that, female coupling is like that, heterocupling is like that, chance coupling is like that. And that's the LGBTQI plus community. The definitions or the labels keep increasing because there's so much there in terms of gender and sexuality, in terms of coupling and stuff like that.
1661718768.0-1661730430.0
So what is unconventional, really? Is it in our heads, or is. It something that's sort of defined anything outside the hetero paradigm?
1661733910.0-1661772910.0
I'm just curious about one more thing, because when I was Strictly unconventional, I also realized that even though I'm watching a lot of work, there is very little work that you can call truly diverse or representational that's happening in contemporary theater at the moment. There are the standalone, there is anakshambara. Occasionally there are plays like that. So what do you think about that? Do you think the future of Indian contemporary theater is going to be more diverse, or why is there a lack of diverse themes?
1661775410.0-1661808220.0
When you say diversity, do you mean in terms of casting or storytelling or stories? Stories and storytelling primarily to begin with, at least, because I feel like the other battle is a longer one, because the circuit I think we've lost Foise. I'm just going to take a moment and check if she can join us again.
1661824330.0-1661827080.0
Yes. You're back. Yeah.
1661830730.0-1661885440.0
Do you think primarily the stories and the storytelling? I think, see, there might be a couple of things. For me, it's very important, the diversity of the storytelling and the stories, because particularly with Strictly Unconventional, I was like, we don't have representation of these stories and Strictly unconventional, it was very important that and as I was going through, it was like, oh, my God, there's this and there's that. There's like single mothers, there's families that have two mothers, whatever, that have a daughter, then not necessarily one person is connected to as a blood relationship, but this idea of family, of relationships, what we call it's, so important. And I don't think enough because we are giving these very bubbles of our lives and our traditions and things like that.
1661888370.0-1661926250.0
If you are a queer person and you are in the queer circle, of course, these are just preaching to the converted, but in the sense a lot of people don't know, some people won't know what the word gender means, what does it mean? And we need to bring it out there. It just works. Getting used to it. Like, I was telling somebody that it's quite like in Indian cinema, like a lot of Bollywood stuff, like, a man, he's teasing a woman to woo her is normalized.
1661926670.0-1661942400.0
It's not unconventional. And we watch it and we're like, oh, okay, wow. Wait, why is she being so, you know, high handed? And we normalize that as wooing? Why can't we then?
1661942770.0-1661991630.0
If I am able to, I'm in a position that I can't tell my stories normalized things that we don't normally see as in same sex genders on stage, dealing with not how we have sex, but mental health, other aspects. Mental health. Mental health, which can be anybody. Can be anybody, right. It's also part of my privilege as a storyteller to be able to give representation to stories and to normalize visuals that are not we don't consider normal or traditional.
1661992530.0-1662024422.0
Is your man and a woman talking about a pregnancy and a wife, it's fine. But if that is two women or two men for maybe five, seven minutes, you'd be like this. Or like, I don't really agree with this, but at some point, your eyes, your ears will start acclimatizing to it. At some point, you'll be okay. And I think that's important that it doesn't suddenly become like, oh, my God, what is it?
1662024556.0-1662070440.0
Unconventional? It's like, yeah, we enjoyed the stories presented to the stories versus saying, oh, great couple, you know what I mean? Where it becomes part of our everyday visual and understanding and context. That coupling can happen with anybody. So I think that is important also to remember some actors who are terrible, but you keep watching them, they say, okay, she was not very good in that, but now she's normalizing things, right?
1662071850.0-1662088970.0
Negative normalization, they can be positive. Normalizations also. And I think normalization because I don't know better word, but acclimatizing people, you know, it's like your body. Like today I run five minutes, I get tired. But after a week, I can run for ten minutes and not get tired.
1662089050.0-1662112546.0
It's just that kind of thing. You get used to it. And we need to get people used to seeing stories about different genders and sexualities in the same way as you watch a heteronormative couple stage. So I think that's very important for me. And hence almost all my players will have that departure from the hetero.
1662112578.0-1662151250.0
Yeah, there will be either homosexual couple or something that is not considered heteronormative, like not heteronormative. It will be in my case, because I think on a subtle level also, people are gauging it. They will start asking and without necessarily throwing it in their face and saying no. It's like, yeah, like in Bone of Contention, two girls are having a relationship, and you keep guessing around it. The gen boy.
1662151400.0-1662152450.0
He's gay.
1662155430.0-1662199806.0
The asexual party couple, everybody keeps calling them lesbians and making fun of them and stuff like that. But that's the whole point, is that nobody can accept these two women living together for the last 25 years. They have to be labeled as lesbos or, you know, something. But I think just by bringing that in, you are still asking of the audience that acceptance and the acclimatizations to different coupling. And for me, I think that is very important to have that representation, to keep giving it till it's not a novelty.
1662199918.0-1662220742.0
It's there, it's part of life. And I think that is something that I always do think of. Like, I think of casting women or giving women parts, even though I write a lot, that I think like a very traditional man. Sometimes I'm surprised at myself. I'm just like what?
1662220876.0-1662243920.0
But you do have those misogynistic male voices in your head that you can write. And I often then pull back and say, okay, I'm going to read this with women. I'm going to read this with different people, not only three men or two men, you know, I'm going to read them with different people so that I know that it can be anybody.
1662246770.0-1662281114.0
Makes sense. So do you see a lot of that changing in theater, contemporary theater at large as well? Because your home still stands out? So that's what I'm trying to say. I know what you're saying, but I think see, there's also and it's hard to state because then it will sound like a judgment of other people, but people are theater as per their reflection of life and what stands out to them.

So who am I to say that there's not enough of this happening? If there's not enough of this happening, then I should be doing it if I think that if somebody else thinks that, they should be doing it. Right. So what I can do as a creator is tell the stories that matter to me. And it matters to me to have representation on stage.
1662302638.0-1662339374.0
Like, for example, I know I completely have failed in the department of differently abled people on stage, for example, representation of that. But am I going to feel horrible about that or at least look at the aspect of, okay, I do want to have more female representation. I do keep things of LGBTQIA plus because I feel that's important now. I don't know if I can actually always cast from that school, from the community. I don't know enough people.
1662339572.0-1662359090.0
And for me, it's more important to have a strong actor than necessary to have a person from that community, necessarily. But yeah, I think I will do what I have to do. So I don't know what other people are doing or working on. Maybe there isn't enough representation.

Who's to say how people want to do theater so that it's slightly commercially viable to them? There are different stories that people want to tell that do not include gender, sexuality, cast, or class. Maybe it's something else that I don't know anything about. So I think for me to say anything about that would sound quite judgmental to my own community, which I feel like is not right, because I think everybody who creates is creating to reflect the world around them. And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work.
1662401720.0-1662429014.0
Sometimes you might be affected by it, sometimes you may not. Sometimes you play safe just for financial reasons. I can understand. I totally understand. So I feel like as a theater person, sure, there's always room for more and like, kujaena do a lot of gender, sexuality based stuff and push the envelope.
1662429062.0-1662481222.0
In that sense, there is spoke for more, but then who am I or anybody to tell other people what should be done or what if I feel it, I'm going to do it, regardless of what I think other people should be doing, because I really, honestly stopped doing that. When you're younger, you just say, oh, my God. I think more appreciative of people who are doing theater generally. I know the blood, sweat and tears that go into that. And I don't graduate anybody doing work that's more commercially viable also because theater is very difficult space to exist, especially if you're a Pink director.
1662481366.0-1662507330.0
Kind of bending it a bit, I think. To each their own. And yeah, there's always space for more representation, but I think people have different ways of thinking or representing or stressing them. Maybe don't stick with mine.
1662510410.0-1662525260.0
That makes sense. I just have one last little question for you, and I know you have to be somewhere. So what are you working on next? What should we expect from you? And also anything that you want to say about upcoming shows.
1662526350.0-1662540122.0
Where can people watch Strictly Unconventional next or Shikandi, whichever one you're doing, when. We can watch it? I don't know. We have a date on the 4 September. Most likely we're doing it at NCPS.
1662540186.0-1662554706.0
Strictly Unconventional. Okay. But again, that's not so long. But it's a long way. But as you know, it's really hard to get dates and actually have gallons like shows that you're going to do.
1662554728.0-1662581914.0
So as the dates keep coming along, I'll let you know. What was the other question? What are you working on next? What am I working on next? Well, I'm hoping we can run Strictly Unconventional, but hopefully if I do playing work, I want to open another play, which is smaller play.
1662581952.0-1662600690.0
Again, five people, unlike 200 people, it's called Afterlife. I don't want to say too much about it, but it's about three people arguing about the afterlife based on their religious beliefs.
1662604710.0-1662631190.0
And then the universe shows them the light, so to speak. But yeah, that is sort of the play that I've been wanting to do for a while. Because it's smaller cast, hopefully it will be less no, I shouldn't say it because I was going to say it'll be simpler, I thought simpler? No, not a chance. So I don't want to say it's simpler, but it is a smaller cast.
1662631270.0-1662652814.0
So just by virtue of a smaller cast, it might be simpler, but by virtue of me being me, it'll still be hard. I think that's what I'm looking to work on. But I've written a couple of other place. Runaway brides. A profit for profit and cover club.
1662652862.0-1662659650.0
Shamshan membership. These are the three plays that I have written, which I hope will happen. But there's a bigger task.
1662663350.0-1662680570.0
Is there anybody she is like putting money on my place. Yes, that's always welcome. We hope you can find all the funding and we hope we get to see all these plays soon. Thank you. I don't mind people casting me in prisons and web series.

Then I don't need a predator. We hope that happens too. Thanks so much again, Foisey, for joining us. It's been a wonderful conversation. I've had a great time and I hope.
1662695172.0-1662704000.0
You do. Thank you. Thanks a lot. And we hope to have you again on Cool Case sometime soon. Whenever your next day is out.
1662704610.0-1662710920.0
Thanks so much. Lovely talking. Thanks twice. Bye bye. How do I end this?
1662711290.0-1662711700.0
I will.

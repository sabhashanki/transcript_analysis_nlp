Mr. Raghu Vanshi has been a host with News Track, india's first video news magazine where he had extended intensively reported on the Kashmir crisis starting from the first ever news report that had warned of terrorist insurgents in the valley in July 1989. Today we'll find him in conversation with Mr. Viveknihotri whom we all know as the director of the recent blockbuster The Kashmir Files. The FRIM chronicled the plight of Kashmiri pundits following terrorist insurgency in the valley in early 1990s.

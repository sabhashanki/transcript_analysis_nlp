1658254170.0-1658284034.0
Welcome everyone, to another round of you. A quick introduction before we start. So we are a part of an organization called Deepstrate. It's a strategic consultancy and think tank. And the idea is that we have some esteemed guests on this platform with whom we discuss various issues which are very current, related to public policy, related to new ideas, new concepts, new initiatives.
1658284162.0-1658308506.0
And with that in mind, we are starting off with a very distinguished guest, Mr. Shashi, who is also a friend. And he just relinquished his position as CEO of Prasad Harti. As many of you know, Prasad Bharti is a public broadcaster which runs Dhol, Darshan and Albionia Radio. And Shashi came in.
1658308528.0-1658325682.0
And as his handle on Pulke or Twitter suggests, shashi digital. He's been somebody who's been working for many years in the digital medium. He's been CEO of several companies and then he was CEO of Prasad Bharti. And he turned around Prasad Bhatti in a big way. He maximized it.
1658325736.0-1658346540.0
He took it to very new heights which exploited digital platforms and he ensured that it can embrace new technologies in a big way. So we are very lucky and it's a privilege to have somebody like Shashi with us. So welcome Shashi, and thank you for being part of this conversation. Thank you. Very happy, very excited to be here.
1658347070.0-1658355450.0
Bring back every such interactive format, going way back to the blogging.
1658358850.0-1658392610.0
Which I think is a perfect way for me to also talk about the platform we are on, which is something that we are associated with, which is full K. And we're very proud to have this platform because it's completely designed by Indians, funded by Indians, traded by Indians. That's something that I'm always very proud to say about this platform. But it also ensures that here people can come together, have conversations, but the audience is at the center of the conversation. So, Shashi, even you can see on your panel, you'll get to see audience interaction.
1658392690.0-1658429294.0
So every time the audience posts a question or we have etc, we take a look at that at some stage. If we want to bring somebody in, we'll also have a feature called Wildcard Density and we'll bring that person in. So why we have gathered today is basically to talk about there's a lot of technology is impacting the world in ways that we are just about discovering and it's been happening in a big way. And big tech companies which come in have also created a lot of platforms, which we technically call it social media intermediaries or social media platforms. And they come in and they have a huge impact on society.
1658429342.0-1658463950.0
And today we are witnessing that across the globe, in many countries, there are issues about data privacy. Then we are seeing social media kind of interaction there that are impacting politics, that is impacting economy, that is impacting social cohesion, they're impacting law and order challenges, et cetera. So there's a whole lot of things that's going on. So, keeping that in mind, we thought we'll have a quick discussion and figure out that how do we sort of regulate big tech social media platforms and we couldn't have somebody better than Shashi. So, any opening thoughts, Shashi, over?
1658464100.0-1658494710.0
How do we look at some of these challenges? First of all, let me compliment. You spoke about the platform that is created by Indians for India. I think it's very important because almost every tech platform out there which has come to occupy the public sphere, become the public square, so to speak, is a platform that is from outside India. So it is a very late beginning and platform growing even further.
1658495630.0-1658521250.0
In terms of initial thoughts. Clearly we are at a very critical juncture in the geopolitical scenario. We've seen how one platform can shut off an entire point of view and shape the discourse. Almost overnight. We've seen the power of platforms.
1658522150.0-1658573346.0
Platform someone who is a very prominent public voice, for example, they've seen external non state actors influence public discourse, attempt to influence election, the electoral process, the democratic process, by creating all sorts of bots and all kinds of disinformation. So platforms have come to play a very crucial role. And we can see the power of the platform is being tested in different ways by different players. Clearly, this is a moment that calls not only for how do we regulate what is happening, but how do we also think about the future? Because the pace at which innovation is happening, we are almost playing catch up most of the time.
1658573528.0-1658591302.0
We need to get ahead of this cycle, this curve, anticipate what likely challenges these platforms will pose in the future. And people, Shashi may also request you to speak a little further into the line. We can hear you. Then we'll be able to hear you. Okay.
1658591356.0-1658605226.0
Is this better? A lot better. Thank you so much. I think you've raised some very interesting points that we've looked at how platforms are being weaponized to create disinformation. It's influencing elections that we've seen from the US case.
1658605328.0-1658620974.0
It's deep platforming people. So suddenly a platform has the right to decide who can be heard, who can't be heard. So that's a lot to unpack. And I think also we've just been joined by Shrupi Shreya. She is a lawyer.
1658621102.0-1658642070.0
She actually specializes in platform regulation and online safety related issues. She's a senior program manager with the Dialogue, which is a delay wasting time company that I'm also associated with. So we'll also bring her in as and when we need certain points of the law, et cetera. So thank you Shuki, for joining us and welcome to Pulkin.
1658645770.0-1658666910.0
So, coming back to some of the issues that Shashiu pointed out. So how do you think Nation should tackle with regulating these platforms? Especially, for example, let's say, D platform? Should a platform have the right to depletform somebody? And if so, under what circumstances?
1658709650.0-1658720670.0
Shashi, can you hear us? You want me to join back? No. Should I join back? No, it's a broadband connection.
1658720750.0-1658724020.0
I think it's a connectivity issue.
1658727190.0-1658731990.0
Yeah, go ahead. Hang on, I'm just changing my network. I'm just changing my network.
1658735450.0-1658740502.0
How is it now? Much better, thanks. Hello? We can hear you. Go ahead.
1658740556.0-1658764346.0
Much better. Okay, great. Yeah, I just switched network. Yeah. So I was saying that whenever you go to any public space which is privately owned, we had a restaurant, we had a mall, we had a Cineplex, for example, you conduct yourself by certain non certain rules, and any such property obviously reserves the right of admission.
1658764538.0-1658795146.0
So to that extent, yes, the platform may have certain rules of conduct, and everyone who uses that service on that platform has to abide by certain norms or so on. I think where the problem comes with the platforming or whatever we see is the arbitrary manner in which it is done, or the opaque manner in which it is done. I think that is where it gets problematic. So it's not so much should a platform have rules for who is allowed, who's not allowed. I think every public space should have that.
1658795168.0-1658818210.0
Otherwise it ends up being anarchical and very difficult to do anything meaningful on such an environment. So, clearly, rules are important, but I think they show us how those rules are applied. Are they applied consistently? Are they applied in a fair manner? What is the grievance mechanism and is there an appellate process?
1658818360.0-1658848860.0
Right. If you're not happy with the decision, and is it done in a transparent way rather than in the opaque, arbitrary way in which the platforms have conducted themselves? Like, my own Twitter handle was randomly suspended one fine morning last year, and it was for the most stupid of reasons that I was just complaining about an offensive hashtag. And their algorithms perhaps could not even make a distinction between people who are using an offensive hashtag and someone who's drawing attention to an offensive hashtag. Right.
1658849310.0-1658881462.0
That is one gap that I see. When you are applying or policing your environment, you have to have certain groups and you have to go about it in a very fair and transparent way and have a provision for an appeal or some kind of a grievance address mechanism. I think that is the key thing. If you could tell us, where does India law stand and how does it compare to global standards as far as what Shashi just okay. Yeah.
1658881596.0-1658912670.0
So as Shashi mentioned, it's always important to have some kind of Gravance addressing mechanism to ensure accountability in the way the platforms act or the way user interests can be protected. So India already has regulations around this. Such regulations exist across the world. US has and India legislated the It rules of 2021. So these rules have been formulated under the It Act, which is the principal law that regulates the digital space.
1658912740.0-1658934946.0
So does it also specifically talk about D platform or is there any specific provision? So there is no specific provision which will look at deep platforming, but there is provisions on content and if people have an issue, then they can go to the Grievance address. Right? But there is nothing specific about platforming or deep platform. There is nothing about platforming or deep platforming.
1658935058.0-1658976466.0
But definitely the companies have their own terms of service and community guidelines. And there are certain international frameworks, like the Santa Clara Principles, which define what kind of terms of service and community guidelines the platform should have. So the platforms generally say that the person was the platforms because he or she failed to abide by the terms of service of the platform. So this terms of service is like a contract between the platform and the users. And these international frameworks, like the Santa Clara Principles, give an overarching guideline as to what kind of contract or the terms of service the platforms can have.
1658976568.0-1658986520.0
And then the laws that the government has created that has the Gravance regression mechanisms through which the users can file, appeal or understand.
1658990250.0-1659020210.0
What should be mentioned. It's an interesting thing that, for example, not everything has to be per se regulated in a framework of law. There could also be principles. For example, she referred to these anti Clara principles during its time in India. We also, as a community of users and creators, et cetera, also come up with our own set of principles, if not regulation, but at least principles, so that there are certain guidelines and best practices which apply to us in our cultural context.
1659020870.0-1659053580.0
Absolutely. I think we should, and we should do it in a manner where it is user friendly, it's easily accessible, people know what their rights are. Where should they go if there's a green one, right? Like what we have seen very often. In fact, I'm seeing a comment right now someone was being banned and we've seen this over and over, when suddenly you find that your account is suspended or you're no longer able to tweet or post or do anything, and most of the time you don't even know what is the trigger for it.
1659054030.0-1659088550.0
That lack of transparency is a problem. Secondly, if you look at how we transact in the real world, rarely you have an extreme step taken, right? You sent a notice first, or first notice, or a second notice, or three strikes before you're out. So practically in every other sphere there is a cadence graded, right? While what I've seen is that most of the platforms seem to act rather in a sudden extreme manner over these small instances, a small insert.
1659088890.0-1659134102.0
So clearly we need a framework. And that framework has to take into account our cultural context, as you rightly pointed out, so that there are some commonly accepted marks and all of them need to operate within a fair manner where you act in a measured response which is graded, where there's an opportunity for someone to, you know, go back and correct something. I recall a few years back, this was probably 2012 or 2013, when, you know, a whole bunch of people were called by the It department back then that, you know, they were using offensive images and so on. Right. Again, these are the kinds of things where some of them could have just been an honest mistake that someone didn't know that, you know, this is not to be used.
1659134156.0-1659166362.0
Right. Where is the opportunity to tell them and give them an opportunity to remediate, if possible? If it is something that was an honest mistake, the framework has to allow for all of us. Understood. So you mentioned transparency, but many times we've also seen that when social media platforms are forced to take down content after a notice from the government, now, Indian law is not very transparent, especially section 69 of the It Act, which says that blocking order, etc.
1659166426.0-1659177826.0
Will have to be completely secret and so on and so forth. So do you think transparency should apply to government notices as well? Yes. Again, not everything is a national security threat. Right.
1659177848.0-1659222930.0
So where of that threshold, yeah, maybe you maintain secrecy, you maintain whatever is required, but something which is below that threshold can be dealt with in a much simpler manner. I don't see a need for that kind of framework where everything is fixed. Why I ask this question is because the fact that, say, a Twitter handle or a Facebook page has been banned, that anyway is not secret because it's already displayed that as per orders received from the government of India, or a quote in India, this is blocked, et cetera. However, the user, and sometimes us as interactive users really don't know why this order came. So in such a case, should there be transparency?
1659224870.0-1659271780.0
I fully agree that there has to be transparency and this can be done in a much simpler manner, where today, with the help of technology, with the help of algorithms, you can make it a lot easier for users. To know what actions of this are the trigger for this kind of blocking or take down or whatever step that is being taken so that they can remediate. If it's something that can be remedied. So that opportunity should be created within that framework and all of this can be made online and automated technology. And in either case, if it is replatformed by the platform itself or because of support order or a government order, there should be provisions for appeal in either case, I guess.
1659272230.0-1659310110.0
Absolutely. And I would say in fact, today, if you look at Broadcast, for example, right, you have a three tier system where at the first layer itself is the channel, then it is the association which has their own self regulatory mechanism. It goes to the highest level tier of the government only in the rarest of rare case. And I think a similar model can be deployed here where the platforms themselves are held to account but are able to take care of these things within their framework without requiring this kind of intervention. Understood?
1659310450.0-1659339720.0
Should he you wanted to come in and ask a question? I just wanted to add in that they are the blocking rules under section 69 A. So maybe a little more transparency therein can also solve a lot of the problems. Like a committee is constituted under rule seven of the blocking rules which reviews every take down order of the government. So maybe having representation from judicial officers and civil society there can ensure more cohesive decision making.
1659340170.0-1659407798.0
And also when the notices that the government gives under section 69 A, many times some people are many times some people say that maybe having more defined notices as to explaining the reasons there. Would be okay, thank you so much. Now, you wanted to add something? Yeah, I wanted to just add something that when I look at the pattern or the trend of locking or click on any of these instances, a lot of them stem from the fact that many of the users of the handles are anonymous and they don't have the same kind of accountability that someone who willingly identifies themselves. Now, anonymity is one thing from a public interface standpoint but I think on the back end perhaps there could be a rule or a norm that says that you have to identify yourself to the platform in some manner so that you are accountable for your use.
1659407824.0-1659453350.0
And I think if you look at print media, you look at broadcast media or any other regulated media, there is editorial accountability for opinion with respect to that. So something similar where you could be anonymous to the world but you could still be identifiable to the platform so that there is a sense of responsibility in what you put in what you say. So there's an interesting question that has come up. Wije has forced this question. There are sovereign nations and how do they deal with say, transactional tech platforms that may be working towards goals that are completely opposed to what are the objectives of that sovereign nation.
1659453430.0-1659466640.0
So how do you balance this? Ultimately the law of the land has to prevail. The constitution of the two platforms can't be subordinate to whatever is the law.
1659469890.0-1659517306.0
Now, the duty of the internet is that borders have become redundant. Yes, it has allowed for flow of information, flow of ideas across borders, which was great for innovation, which is great for a whole new technology, things that have got it along the way. But ultimately this has to happen within the boundaries of the constitution, the laws of the land. And to that extent, if something is violating it or something is actively working against your sovereignty in the right to take action. And I think that is what has come to the fourth, which you see in the last few months in this conflict between Ukraine and Russia and in the role of platforms and entities on both sides.
1659517418.0-1659568154.0
I think those questions have come to the fourth. Now, of course, there is this whole school of thought that the internet has to be free, it has to be open. This is fine from a technology standpoint, it is fine from a protocol standpoint. But what happens, what applications, what content gets created, what content gets exchanged using those protocols that has to abide by whatever are the use of the last. Which also brings me to this very interesting point that when it comes to, shall we say, some of the social media companies, some of them have taken the government of India to court, like one company took the government of India to court saying that some of the takedown notices are against the principles and constitutional right of freedom of speech.
1659568282.0-1659605498.0
Another says that it could cause a lot of user harm because you will be able to track who's saying what beyond the necessity and proportionate guidelines that dictate some of these issues and could create a surveillance state. How do you view some of these. Developments on this particular count? I think the platform claiming to speak for free speech I think is a bit rich, especially given the track record and the history of these platforms. First of all, opacity of their algorithms, opacity in the manner in which certain handles are either shadow band or certain kinds of content is pushed up.
1659605584.0-1659640134.0
Certain kind of content is pushed down. So given that history and that track record, it is kind of rich on their part to claim that they are batting for free speech, they're batting for user. Right? I think that sounds quite exaggerated to the extent that certain rules are restricting their commercial activities, they're stunting their growth, maybe they have a case. But to go beyond that and to claim that they are fighting the battle of free speech, which is what I've seen the manner in which the Twitter court case is being projected in the international media.
1659640172.0-1659652860.0
I've seen several global media analysts think tanks trying to portray it as the fight for free speech in India, and Twitter is fighting for you and you need to support. I think that is a lot of the.
1659655090.0-1659679634.0
So what do you think is the position here? I think it's clearly a case of the platform not wanting to comply with Indian law and they're hoping that they can get away with it with this kind of international project. And I think the government was right to read the attack to them, say that you have to comply. And we're already seeing this. Right?
1659679832.0-1659705914.0
Europe has a whole bunch of laws that have come into place with the platform they've had to accept. Australia had a law recently on a different matter more than the commercial rate, but the platforms have had to accept it. Recently I was reading about Ireland, looking at user data and restricting how that user data is moved across borders. So this is happening across the globe. It is not unique to India.
1659705962.0-1659712400.0
So to somehow make it as a free speech issue in India and to project it as of the Indian state is.
1659714930.0-1659754860.0
So here. I would like to pose a question that impaired has posed that is it ethical for governments to have the legal right to force social media platforms to take down content, particularly those that question the government? What do you think about that? Say social media is like any other media, right? So if there is a law or a rule that allows you to take certain actions or certain types of content, which I say certain public orders, which are a direct call to violence, and especially in a country like ours where the state capacity is limited, the threshold for violence is quite low.
1659755390.0-1659792360.0
We will be a little more restrictive than a different state where perhaps the shoulder for violence is not that it's quite high and the state has immense capacity to see public order. There are certain challenges which are unique to India, so they can't be a universal yardstick for free speech and so on. It has to be contextual, it has to be specific to the kind of society that we are. So to that extent, yes, I think it is ethical. However, we should draw a line between is it about criticizing the government or is it about creating content which is likely to lead to breakdown of law or not?
1659793850.0-1659865050.0
But, and this is something you've probably seen, that we've also seen in instances in India where a certain kind of behavior is either punished or allowed to go through scot free on social media, depending on who is in power and which government is closer to that particular user. So in some cases you might have seen somebody who's critical of the government having to face multiple cases, while somebody whose actions or words on social media or any other platform has led to actual writing and cases of violence not being pulled up at all. Forget about which government or what ideology is in power, how do we resolve this contradiction, which is basically show me the face and I'll show you the more right. So I would attribute it more to the early stage of regulating these technologies. If you actually look back before 2014, many of these issues didn't exist because the use of these platforms and these technologies was not as widespread, it was not as ubiquitous.
1659865210.0-1659920894.0
What has happened over the last 8910 years is the usage has become more broad based as smartphones penetration has increased, mobile data has become cheaper. Fairly large marks, which is perhaps not as literate about the norms of behavior or the norms of using these technologies, has come onto these platforms. So I would say we are still in the early stages of regulating these. So I would say irrespective of which party, which government has acted on these instances, perhaps there has to be a broader consensus that these are the acceptable ways in which social media should be handled. And I think that discourse needs to happen and I would say that while specific incidents have been partisan one way or another, this larger debate does not happen.
1659921092.0-1659958222.0
I think there is a role there for parliament, there's a role there for think tanks to forfeit debate so that these rules are applied in a consistent manner. So today, whether you're in power or order of power, the same rules apply. Shooting you heard Shashi and what he said about these debates need to happen, et cetera. What has been the experience in regulation and how has the law evolved so far from the time that he mentioned that these are relatively new areas and we are seeing an explosion of more users coming through smartphones. Our data prices are some of the cheapest in the world.
1659958276.0-1659982662.0
As a result more people are able to come and we are a 1.3 billion strong nation. So a lot of voices, how do you regulate so many voices and so. On and so forth. So what has been the journey so far? So the journey started with the It app enactment which happened in 2000 and since then we've seen a very rapid growth in the use of internet as a whole.
1659982716.0-1660036482.0
Social media came in the early two thousand s and now we are seeing the advent of metaws debt 3.0 there's online gaming, cryptocurrency and with the pandemic setting in a lot more digitization happened with everything moving online. So with this there has been a very genuine need for more regulation and more effective regulation and the government has been working actively towards that. We are seeing, with the emergence of new technologies the regulations have been amended, updated, we are having the Data Protection Law which has been in discussion for a long time and the government is working actively to have a robust data protection legislation for India. We are also seeing discussion around the new It Act and there is discussion around the new cybersecurity policy. So the cybersecurity policy that exists as of now is of 2013.
1660036546.0-1660068290.0
So it needs to be updated. So a lot has happened. These new regulations are in line with the need for more accountability and transparency from the platforms as well as better protection of user interests. We have also seen discussions around platform regulation. Recently a new proposed amendment to the It rules was proposed and there the government is saying that we should have an Applet Committee as well so that the prevailing officer that the platform set up, they have some amount of accountability.
1660068630.0-1660095610.0
And even more interestingly, self regulatory organizations is also something that the government is actively considering, like the meeting has been talking about that for content takedown and content blocking. Also there can be a self regulatory organization. I just interrupt you. For those of us because we speak in a certain language, mati stands for Minister of Electronics Information Technology. So just pointing that out.
1660095680.0-1660098380.0
So when we use the word Mehti, this is what it means.
1660101710.0-1660181346.0
Yeah, I just like to conclude by saying that self regulatory organization is also something the government is considering and this shows that the government is not averse to the idea that the platforms themselves come up and create an effective regulatory model. The objective of the government is that rule of law is maintained on platform and for this I think more effective consultations and dialogues with experts, with all the stakeholders involved can help us navigate to the processing challenges that's coming up and create these laws and regulations more specifically. Thank you, SHUTi so, before I pose the next question to Shashi, small disclosure from my aspect because my bias will obviously come out in a big way in posing this question. So having been a journalist for almost 23 years before I switched the years, you would always wonder that his social media platforms are now sort of cashing in on all the hard work that journalists do and as a result we are losing audience while social media is gaming. Which brings me to the question, shashi, I guess has been on our side in that sense as CEO Prasad Bhatti and therefore kind of on the side of journalists rather than social media platforms.
1660181458.0-1660210846.0
And Shashi, you've seen how Australia, there was this interesting debate that happened and now social media platforms have agreed to pay mainstream media organizations for the content that they use and which actually helps them grow in size and get more users, et cetera. Where do you think India should look at some of these issues? I think it's a great question. I just have one point on the earlier discussion. I just want to add that take on this question.
1660211028.0-1660250906.0
So one thing on this whole issue of large number of new, relatively new users coming onto these platforms, not being aware of how to conduct themselves. So one area that I think both government and NGO and think tanks can think about is teaching kids at the school level itself, how should you conduct yourself in social media? Because it is inevitable that today's kids are tomorrow's social media users and today the kids are already using certain social media platform which most of the time parents are not even aware of. Absolutely. Some of these habits are getting ingrained very early.
1660251008.0-1660293974.0
So if you get it right at those formative view, then you can expect far better environment when these people become adults and they conduct themselves in these larger platforms and contribute to the public discourse. So one example I can think of how this could be done is like just the way early. On in life. There are sunscars that are taught in every family certain values. Perhaps you should have a digital sunscar concept rooted in Indian culture, which also talks about how you should talk to people, how you should because today I see even on the most harmless of issues, the first reaction is abusive because perhaps these guests have just not been taught how to communicate.
1660294022.0-1660307530.0
In these cases, there is a scope for coming up with a set of norms, values, digital norms and digital values, how you conduct yourself. It could be an Indian version, a digital transparent.
1660311010.0-1660342780.0
So coming back to your question about platforms and their mainstream media and sharing revenues and so on, it goes back to discovery of content. How do you discover content on that? In the early days you would go to individual websites, individual portals. Then came your search engines and they acquired a whole lot of Sprint because of keyword based search. Then came these content aggregators like Google News and so on.
1660343550.0-1660396678.0
Today, what I see, especially when I look at analytics on YouTube for as an example, most of the content discovery is happening within the platform and it is algorithm driven and the proportion of content which is coming from external reference is very, very small. So today platforms have moved to a phase where once they bring you in, they keep you within the platform with this infinite discovery model where the algorithm keeps recommending that, now look at this, now look at that. And invariably a major chunk, a majority of the content discovery is happening through algorithms already within the platform. So you are captive in that sense. So given this, I think it is a disproportionate power that the platforms have acquired.
1660396774.0-1660436866.0
So it is fair that there is equitable revenue sharing because after all, the reason why we are on that platform is because of the content, the terms on which the content creators and the platform are sharing revenue. I think there is definitely a case for making it more equitable. And after the Australian law, there has been a movement on the part of the platforms to do something proactively like the Google News initiative and so on. So I think it is an ongoing dialogue. Should the government intervene?
1660436898.0-1660493470.0
I don't know at this stage if it requires government intervention, I think between the platforms and the content providers, since there is already an ongoing dialogue that should go forward. Further, perhaps there's also a case at some point, maybe the regulator can look at, maybe the competition regulator can look at it with a disproportionate amount of content discovery happening through algorithm. Is there a case for relooking at these commercial relationships, which. As you know, I have a kind of vested interest in this question. So would this also apply in a situation where, for example, in a related issue, TV broadcasters for a long time because of the Cable Regulation Act, et cetera, there are a whole lot of entry barriers, fees, so on and so forth.
1660493490.0-1660523906.0
But OTTs don't have any of that. So they should also either pay and have that many rules and regulations or we should be freed up a lot more. Do you think that kind of works also like debate? I'm not so sure because I think the licensing framework for broadcast platforms is pretty old school, right? And the big difference with the tech platforms and digital platforms is that it is not just licensed content which is available.
1660524008.0-1660546890.0
There's a whole lot of user generated content which you don't have in broadcast, which you don't have in the traditional media. That's a great point. So I don't think the same norm should apply. However, I think the reverse is suit. And I think a lot more thought process can go into how you can automate use technology, use algorithms to regulate all media.
1660546960.0-1660586214.0
Because today content source is available in every mode, it could be available in the traditional broadcast mode, it could be available in the live stream mode, it could be available in the catch up mode, and Snippets could be available for on demand consumption across a whole range of things. Some of these videos can be forwarded on peer to peer sharing app that was prep and so on. You need a 360 approach to regulation anyway and hence the way to do that would be to bring in tech enabled tools, more AI. So you need a regulatory framework which is 21st century. Sudhi, where do you think we are?
1660586252.0-1660615226.0
Are we still in the 21st century as far as our regulatory modes are concerned or we are slightly around the 19th century? I would say that that is the nature of law and technology. That the technology always keeps running and the law tries to catch up. The technology is advancing rapidly, the law is trying to catch up but still there is a lot of scope. But we are in phase of the data protection.
1660615258.0-1660649238.0
Law is coming, the cybersecurity policy is being updated the platform, but like we. Saw in Australia where platforms are now being asked to have some revenue sharing with content. Do you think that's a good idea? Yes, I think something along those lines would be good enough because that helps create a more level playing field and in fact I think there is a new amendment that the government is considering with respect to news aggregators in India. Also they have considering to bring an amendment.
1660649414.0-1660692678.0
So something around these lines would be necessary to ensure that there is a more level playing field and all the players are given more equitable opportunity. But definitely the issues around ensuring greater innovation and the providing ease of doing business should also be considered and taken into consideration. So the fair and legitimate interest of all the parties should be catered to while also ensuring that equal chance and equitable market space is there. Understood. So shashi since I'll now dip into the role that you've played for the last several years as CEO Prasad Bharti, et cetera and this has been a conversation that has happened many times.
1660692844.0-1660727620.0
What is the role of the public broadcaster and how do we look at it? And there's been a lot of debate around the independence, the so called independence of the public broadcaster. Where do you think we stand? Visa we say a BBC or the other countries which have a public broadcaster but have a certain degree of support from the government and licensee and so on and so forth to ensure a certain degree of independence or autonomy. Where do you see peace time and where should we go from our current position?
1660728470.0-1660760830.0
So our model for the public broadcasting is very different from the rest of the world. I think it's very important to understand this. As you rightly mentioned, many of them have what is called a license fee and this license fee is mandatory paid by the citizens irrespective of whether they consume public media or not, right? And to take the example of BBC, BBC gets license revenues. Currently though there's an active political debate on changing that model but in Indian Rupee terms it adds up to 30,000 pros annually.
1660761810.0-1660795050.0
Now, if you look at a BBC and you look at a door dashan or an All India Radio, there is no comparison. BBC barely operates less than ten channels, a handful of radio services. Durhushan operates 30 plus TV channels, all India Radio operates 400 plus radio stations. So you're talking of 30,000 crores of input into a handful of a bouquet of services while on the other hand there is no license fee in India. DD and AR have to earn their revenues to operate, to meet their operating costs so their salaries are taken care of by the government grant.
1660795790.0-1660831278.0
So you're talking of a few thousand crores of input to run bouquet of services which is 20 times 30 times much larger and also much more diverse. The big difference between our country and every other country's public broadcaster is that they can get away with a language. We have to do 30 4500 languages dialects, so the sheer diversity is so wide. So that is the big difference with the model of public broadcasting here and there. The other thing about diversity of opinion, again, it is a misconception.
1660831454.0-1660866922.0
For example, Dodashan operates DD Freddish, which carries more than 25 news channels and these news channels are available free to air in every home that has a DDF that covers there's a plurality of opinion there. So it's not just DD news version that is going out, it is DD news plus 25 other opinions that are going out. So in that sense I don't see this and no other public broadcaster in the world does. They don't have a platform, they don't carry their competitors and provide space for such a plurality of houfini. So in that sense, I wouldn't worry too much about independence.
1660867066.0-1660909274.0
I would be more concerned about global debate that is happening, which is how public media will be sustained. And this debate is happening in every country. Those with licensee and those without licensee as well. And increasingly where we are seeing content being consumed on digital and through social media and so on, and traditional broadcast is becoming less and less important. I think it becomes all the more crucial to look at new technologies, technologies like for example, direct to mobile broadcasting, which is now emerging as a possibility with Pi, G and so on, so that you're not hostage to a particular platform, you're not hostage to a particular social media tool acting as a gateway.
1660909402.0-1660944870.0
Today, if you look at the Reuters Institute's latest study, they have estimated that in India the majority of the online news consumption is through YouTube. So YouTube as a single platform is accounting for about 63% of digital news consumption. And as I mentioned earlier, it's all algorithm driven, right? I think that is a bigger concern. So we have to have alternatives where the message can go out independently, directly to smartphone, since most of the audience is on smartphone.
1660945390.0-1660955690.0
But is there a way we can prevent the government of the day having a major say in the performance or the content, et cetera, institution.
1660957890.0-1660986406.0
As long as you have a mix of opinions? I don't think that is an issue because there is also a case for the public view to be put out there from the government or the state. For example, take the case of what happened during COVID-19. I think that is a classic example, instructive example, that overnight situation can change and the most responsible voice if it is not heard. You look at what has happened in the rest of the world, right?
1660986508.0-1661019474.0
So much of vaccine, hesitancy so much and so many myths because it is a three, four one. While here you had the government broadcaster and the other entities working overnight to dispel such a large volume of disinformation daily. Thousands of fake news would be busted during COVID so that the right message is out there. And it was so important. So I don't think you can wish away this role, this space for the state, for the government, but at the same time, yes, you have other streams as well.
1661019512.0-1661072402.0
So there is a plurality on issues that matter, while on issues which are of national and public interest and national importance, you have the ability to deliver the state's voice, those who are responsible and accountable to the people. So your point again is excellent. Like what you mentioned about the government should have a platform which is fairly big and influential, especially during public emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic where voice of authority with credibility can cut through this maze of disinformation, misinformation fake theories and come up with the factual correct position. Absolutely I would say a similar role when we have exigencies like a country which has faced Pakistan sponsored terrorism, 20 611, the attack on Mumbai. Again, the role of the public broadcaster would become absolutely essential in situations like that.
1661072456.0-1661098066.0
But these are said and done exceptional situations. What I'm thinking of, or what I'm coming to mind is, can we see a yes, Minister or a yes, Prime Minister mocking the government as a serial on Dur Dash? Well, you could have DD Pradesh as a platform. You have all kinds of serial burdens. But I'm not talking about other can burger shim.
1661098098.0-1661128674.0
It's not a big believer in public media being necessarily adversarial, but I've been following the debate in UK, especially on BBC, and how they're because I think public media has a larger responsibility not not to get caught up in these adversarial. So you are not in favor of a yes, Minister or yes, Prime Minister. On the I don't think it is important that let me put it that way. I think it is far more important for me to make sure that in the Northeast I'm getting the right public messages. Go, you could have both.
1661128872.0-1661139640.0
Well, instead I will enable private. They do a far better job. They'll probably make a much more entertaining yes, Minister. Why? Why do you want the taxpayer funded broadcaster to make a yes bonus which will probably suck it?
1661140170.0-1661173540.0
Okay, that's a good point, that it might not do a great job. So I have an interesting question or a viewpoint from Tanya Thomas, who is one of her colleagues on pulpit. She says that how much on the content and the revenue sharing part that we discussed a little while ago, does that Australian model really work in a country like India? Because there is also a big monopoly within the mainstream media. In Australia, there's one group that controls 90% 95% of the media there.
1661173990.0-1661222430.0
But in a country like India, which has diversified news media with multiple owners, this content, revenue sharing, might become a barrier to the industry at the entry point. Do you think that's a legitimate view? No, I think she's probably gotten two different issues mixed up because if I recall correctly, the Australian model was about the smaller news outlets, the local media getting their seat. So that was the genesis of why they wanted this arrangement, so that local news is sustained and preserved. And especially after COVID, a lot of local media outlets have faced an existential crisis.
1661222510.0-1661251660.0
That is the larger background. But I think what Google has done in India, I think is a good start. At least they reached out to the business platform that they have started working on, rewriting these terms of revenue sharing. Perhaps more of that can happen. And also, perhaps the competition regulator can also look at what is the power of these algorithms, how much of it, especially 63% of digital news disruption within one of these platforms, right?
1661253970.0-1661279182.0
There is hope to do more in it. So when you say look at the algorithms, could we also have some IP related challenges to protect your IP? How much of my algorithm can I actually show? Absolutely. I think that is the tension that is going to be there, right, between the transparency of the algorithms and the intellectual property and the innovation.
1661279326.0-1661300054.0
How do you balance these two? I think it's going to be the regulatory challenge of the future. And we have figured out so we. Are down to the last seven minutes of this conversation, quickly shooting. Where do you think from a regulatory point of view, how much does it permit or require algorithms to be shown?
1661300102.0-1661328318.0
Is it even possible? What are your final thoughts on that? Second, I lost you in the first part of the question. Like, what we were discussing was that governments should look at algorithms because algorithms give a lot of power to these platforms, but there could be IP related challenges in sharing algorithms. How much of algorithms should be let the government see, so on and so forth.
1661328414.0-1661360640.0
Where is the Indian law on this and how much is allowed? Okay, so right now, there isn't any compulsion from the government with respect to disclosure of algorithms like the It rules or any other platform regulation. The It Act or any other rules under the It Act doesn't talk about that. But should we therefore have some provision that allows this? And is it even possible without compromising on intellectual property?
1661362370.0-1661422850.0
There are intellectual property concerns with respect to public disclosure of algorithms. So I won't say that it's a very good practice there to have the disclosure of the algorithms, because then that also makes the algorithms vulnerable to more attacks from hackers who might get access and then they might infiltrate it in a way that instead of getting the good out of the disclosure, a lot more bad can happen. However, some amount of or some kind of independent review of these algorithms is important, and some guidelines can be created along those lines that the companies have to conduct an independent assessment from an independent expert body that assesses the algorithms from time to time and gives independent feedback around how the algorithms are developed more holistically and how the bias related issues are tackled there. Great, thank you. So one final question to you, Shashi, and we'll also look forward to your final thoughts and comments.
1661423190.0-1661445546.0
This question comes from, again, one of our users. So there are some cases where in the name of the nation wants to know, and the country wants to know. Some channels end up becoming judge, jury, and executioner. Where and I'm not taking any name there. Leave it to your wise imagination to figure out who it could be.
1661445648.0-1661479650.0
But where do you think from a public dot since the experience you've had, et cetera, how do we look at some of those issues. I think it's all about the audience. Ultimately, there is a market for that kind of content on these channels. There is no way you can force them to stop being all of that. So it's a larger societal question in my opinion, that should we be patronizing content of that nature?
1661479730.0-1661523042.0
Like recently I saw in one of the syllable TV channels there was almost abuses being heard at each other on live TV. So I think that is the worst form of primetime content. But in the context of tech platform, which is what I'm guessing the original question was about. So there I think what I said mentioned in the beginning about having an affiliate process and a brief answered mechanism that should take care of it. Today's problem is that there is direct action which is at the most extreme end, which is banning or disabling an account and so on.
1661523096.0-1661528980.0
There are no intermediate steps and there is no appellate process. Those are put in place.
1661531190.0-1661577338.0
Thank you so much, Shashi, it was an absolute pleasure hearing you and we hope you will continue to use Kulkay and have more conversations of your own, which also is a good way to tell anybody who's listening out there that Kulka is a platform created for all of you. So if you want to use it, it's absolutely free. You can have conversations like this and if you can convince Shashi to come and have a conversation with you, you could try that as well, so you can tag him on the platform. So that said, thank you again, Sudhi, and at deep side, we are deeply grateful to both of you for taking the time out and spending time with us and we look forward to more such conversations and hopefully we'll have more, as we said, conversations colgate. And thank you to the audience and have a great evening.
1661577514.0-1661581300.0
Thank you. Bye. Fun and look forward to it. Thank you so much.

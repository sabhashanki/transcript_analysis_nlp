Hi, Santosh. I'm stepping in for Earthy Beera, who wasn't last minute, couldn't make it to the interview. So to everybody watching now, hello and welcome to an edition of India Inc. I'm Tanya Thomas, and today I'm interviewing Santosh Nyer who is a long time reporter and very faithful chronicler of India stock markets. He's is currently group market editor at Network 18 and the author of Bulls Bell is Another Piece, which is a history of the development of the stock market and the major events that have taken us to major events that have happened the last 2030 years.
1658899040.0-1658917550.0
So thanks very much for joining us today, Santosh. And it's really glad, I'm really happy to see you again. We've met as reporters in Mumbai a few times and very happy to have you today. Thank you very much for having me on your platform. Tanya, it's a privilege.
1658917970.0-1658933814.0
Thank you. Thanks, Santos. So for journalists, to journalists, I'm curious. The first thing that I look at to your profile is that you very faithfully stayed in the markets, beat all your career. And I've been a journalist also for ten years now.
1658933852.0-1658974226.0
I've hopped around in different beats, tried different flavors of journalism, flavors within business journalism. Tell me, what is it about the stock markets that has captivated you for so long and that you continue to find it so fascinating that you report in it every day? Well, I think there's something interesting all the time happening in the markets. When you look closely, there are about 3000 odd stocks listed on the BS to at least 250 of them, which are very actively traded. So in that sense, given such a wide canvas, there is always never a dearth of stories to tell.
1658974328.0-1658988006.0
And that's what keeps a journalist going. So that's one reason I stayed. The stock markets always fascinated me. It wasn't that it was a planned career move. I just managed to stumble into it.
1658988028.0-1659000554.0
And having come here, I kind of stayed on. Okay, so tell me, in you started reporting in the 90s. Yes. Ninety s seven is when I joined business standard. Right.
1659000672.0-1659031034.0
Okay. So tell me, as a reporter on the field, there are always certain days that stand out in your memory and either because of something, because of the event that's happened or reaction to it. So tell me about some of those experiences as a journey discovering stock markets. When you think back on your career, what are the most dramatic events that you've been witnessed to? Well, the most dramatic events, I would say was one was the pocran blast and the aftermarketing.
1659031182.0-1659051306.0
That was clearly something. It sent the markets into a tailspin. But before that, you had Asian crisis in 97, 97. It was September, October, that's when it hit. I was just about five, six months into the profession at that point in time.
1659051488.0-1659078946.0
So fair to say that I was unable to grasp the significance of the event at that time. I did write it, but from a very narrow perspective of how the Indian stock market was reacting to the events that were unfolding in Asia at that point. I didn't really understand Currencies that well beyond stocks. And stocks itself was just about six months. So I wasn't fully converted with the stock market also.
1659078968.0-1659105254.0
But Currencies and I still couldn't connect the dots at that point. That is clearly something. But in the midst of that I managed to get my first page one byline which is a badge of honor. Yes, matter of pride. So that was related to the event because the National Stock Exchange altered the daily circuit filters.
1659105382.0-1659128740.0
They revised it. So I happened to meet a senior official there. He told me that this is something they're going to do from the following week. So that was my first page. So that's why I always remember the Asian market crisis then followed the poker and blast and then of course the.com boom of 99 2000.
1659129670.0-1659151180.0
The high highs and the really low lows. It was fun reporting at that point in time. And it was also fun because it was a very different era. It was almost another lifetime. You could say so because meeting up with brokers, senior officials at Exchange, it was not so difficult as it is now.
1659151550.0-1659164222.0
As far as the brokers go, you could just walk into their office after 330. You'd gladly entertain. You getting an appointment with any of the senior officials. It wasn't so much of a problem. You could reach them on the phone.
1659164356.0-1659187238.0
There were no intervening layers that you had to go through. Access was not so much of a problem. Plus the regulations, of course. It was about almost five years since the transition to electronic trading had happened. But still many rules were still being formed and that's what makes it interesting.
1659187404.0-1659189960.0
The market was not mature to see.
1659192650.0-1659229940.0
Yes, regulations had started coming into place, but still there was a very long way to go as the event of 99 2000 showed how it was very easy to kind of game the whole structure, game the whole system. So it was a very interesting phase, something I fondly looked back on. You didn't have internet was just in its infancy at that point in time. You had to actually queue up to access the Internet. At that point there was only one connection in the whole office and there would always be a queue for that.
1659230490.0-1659235880.0
There was a good library. You mean the Times of India? The economic times of the business standard.
1659240490.0-1659261454.0
Market was shallow at that time and it was a column called Street Sands. I used to write today whenever there are big trades, the buyer and the seller has to disclose it to the stock exchange. Yeah, back then that was not the case. And that information was really sought after. Not many people had.
1659261492.0-1659307594.0
But I managed to get in touch with a few brokers and dealers who used to track this information very closely. So I would report on that and imagine how not just shallow, how slow the market, how scared the information was at that point in time because, let's say a trade or a set of trades used to happen on Monday. By the time the market would come to know of it, it would be the following day, the following morning or afternoon after that, I would speak to them, put out a copy based on that, which would then get published on Wednesday. But still, there was a lot of demand for that information because it was not so freely available. Contrast that with today, the moment that's a big deal.
1659307712.0-1659320222.0
By 334, the disclosures are out there. You have an overdose of information. Information was scarce. You had to cultivate people. You wouldn't you would not pick things very easily of the net.
1659320276.0-1659343798.0
And and the funny part I used to remember back then was when I started reporting cell phone calls were still 16 or Rs32 a minute. So when you would call broker, they would say, yeah, hurry up, come on, tell me fast. What is it? Conversations used to be short to the point. Those are some of the things I remember from those days.
1659343964.0-1659379380.0
Very, very eventful, very interesting, right? And when I when I think of the history of the stock market, it's not just in India, but any major stock market in the world. History is often told through personalities who stand in for the events of their time. So whether it's about developments of a stock exchange, whether it's about the scandals that have that have happened, it's always it centers around a single person in this story. That's also how you describe the events in your book.
1659380150.0-1659409062.0
But tell me about the personalities that good or bad, that you have left to market. You do you get a sense that you should feel suspicious of something that everybody else is being very auditory about? Or have you met people in the markets that you have been wary of? Plenty. You get to know of it.
1659409216.0-1659438200.0
There's always a vested interest when people speak to you. But I was fortunate enough to know two or three people who were very straight with me. So if I asked them something which they didn't know, they would tell me, look, I don't know, as opposed to many who would not want to be seen as ignorant about something. So maybe they would give some spin. Maybe sometimes there would be a vested interest.
1659438570.0-1659460542.0
They would try to steer you in a particular direction, whereas with a handful of people, I can't count too many. They would always be very blunt. They would say, that looks Sansuit. I don't know the answer to that. And then as a reporter, I wouldn't know if he's deliberately trying to stonewall me or he doesn't genuinely know the answer.
1659460596.0-1659481780.0
So I would again try to ask that question and differently stretch the conversation. And they would say that, look, you're going to ask me the same question many times, but the fact is I really don't know. I wish I could have helped you. Then I would also kind of back test my sources so people who would give me this information. So Lola was a good informant back then.
1659482950.0-1659506202.0
He had access to a lot of this information, but I would never know. So he would say, okay, this fund is buying. This fund is selling that. So three, four days later or a week later, I would then kind of in the course of the conversation, I would just flip it and say that, look, but this fund, I would reverse it instead of what he had told me. But you said this fund was selling, right?
1659506336.0-1659533970.0
We said no. And again, that's possible only when someone is being honest with you, because remember what you had said, you would recall it exactly, and you would say no. And I would try this with many sources to see if that's the simplest way they tell you something, you remember it. If they make some offhand conversation, off hand remark, then I would kind of keep it for later. At some future point, I would say, is this and slightly to that conversation?
1659534130.0-1659546300.0
No, this is how it went. So that helped me figure out who's being honest, who's not being so honest. Are there any names you wanted to give us?
1659549470.0-1659568606.0
That only too well, Tanya. But I was also talking about when you look at stock market today, even love news stories, look at what Rakh shrinkinwala is buying. Look at how someone the money's investments have done. Where is he invested? How much has he made?
1659568628.0-1659611006.0
How can you become the next big bulls of the stock market? What I meant is that the stories of fame and fortune that are made in the markets are those stories that you think are entirely true or entirely plausible? Yes, it's plausible. But see, the best thing, I think what people like about the stock market, why it draws so many people, is that is one place where people think they can make a lot of money without too much hard work. What does it take to just put your money in a stock and then hope that there are lots of stories told?
1659611188.0-1659637640.0
And the way people used to invest back in the again. A lot of blue chip companies, especially the MNC names. If you were among the fortunate few who managed to buy a lot of shares at throwaway prices, the dividend itself would take care of your expenses for the whole year. Which is what many investors have managed to do. Of course, then it wasn't the case after that, many of these stocks had a good run.
1659638570.0-1659667226.0
But then kind of there's always a reversion to me. But what happened is it had a very powerful narrative around it that you can make a lot of money, you can make fortunes. And to be fair enough, those companies still continue to reward their shareholders, either through dividends or even capital appreciation. Prices have gone up a lot. But you know, when people come to the stock market, it's always the feeling that, oh, I just have to put 50,000 here, and it'll become whatever in a very short time.
1659667348.0-1659691666.0
And then, of course, the media partly has a role in this as well. It always glorifies those stories where investors have made a lot of money. Now, what people forget here is that the investors who have made this fortune, right, they've done it because they depend on it for a living. They have to do it for a living, right? This is not the only stock.
1659691698.0-1659708990.0
So if you look at even Mr. Gingenwala's portfolio, for that matter, there's plenty of stocks, but few of them did extraordinary well. For instance, Titan was one of the stocks which did extraordinary well. He made a lot of money in Crystal Lupin. But there are plenty of stocks which just went nowhere.
1659709330.0-1659723122.0
If you had just followed Mr. Jinjinvala or Mr. Damani into a stock thinking, that okay, the big guys have done their homework. They know what they are buying. All I have to do is just get and hang in there and I'll be rich like them.
1659723176.0-1659748598.0
That's never going to happen. There's clearly an element of survivorship bias here. Even the experts, if you talk to them, they will say that when they are buying a stock, this holds true for the biggest of investors. You ask them, and honestly, they will say that, look, there's no way of knowing whether this is going to become a multi bagger stock, right? There are so many factors involved.
1659748694.0-1659770450.0
You've done a fair bit of research, you know, that okay, this is what the balance sheet looks like. This is what the industry dynamics are. This is what could change, possibly. And you make assumptions, but things can just as well dramatically change new technology or some dispute within the family itself. So many factors.
1659771030.0-1659807898.0
You need to have so many things come together for that to eventually then become multiple. And that's when a lot of people then wake up. But by the time everyone knows about that story, then probably it's early to say, yeah, I'm not so sure whether you make the same kind of returns. So let's say Hindustan, labor, all these stocks are good, you know, high Pedigree, good Pedigree stocks. But for you to make maximum returns on that, it depends on the time frame, you know, when so if you had invested sometime in 2001, or, you know, there was a period of ten years when the stock did nothing.
1659807984.0-1659819486.0
Now look at ITC. For a long time, the stock is really okay. This year, it's been the best performer. All of a sudden, there's up 30% in a market which has been struggling. Most other stocks have taken a beating.
1659819598.0-1659853462.0
But as someone who's been invested in ITC since 2015, you know, you would actually be losing money. You know, you would have been better off having put that money in a fixed deposit. So it also depends the time frame, you know, when did you manage to get if you bought it really low, really cheap? Today's show, I was talking about a company called Symphony, which makes air coolers, 2005, 2006. For a long time, between 2006 to almost 2009, you're getting that stock for sub Rs10.
1659853526.0-1659887654.0
Sub rs10 okay. By 2018, the stock went up to Rs10,000. But for the three, four years when the stock was really languishing, nobody was taking a bet on it because the company had gone sick, it had taken on too much loans, and it had been referred to BIFR. So good. The investors, you know, those wanting to make money, are you willing to go against the tide, bet on a promoter, say that, okay, this is the guy who is struggling, but I think he can probably turn things around, which is what Symphony did.
1659887772.0-1659899914.0
But after 2018, again, that stock has gone nowhere. In fact, it's now down almost 40% from that. It was held as a big turnaround story. It is a turnaround story. If you have been holding the shares for 20 years, probably you're still in the money.
1659900032.0-1659919790.0
But those who have invested, let's say in the last seven years, they have not made any money. In fact, the value of their investment has gone down. So it all depends on time frame. Even after you've done your research, homework, everything still there are a lot of factors. And one thing I can say for sure is the probability.
1659919870.0-1659942238.0
If you just hang on to the coattails of a big name investor, the probability of making money that I think is still far less. I would say do some basic research and take the risk. These people have made that money by taking huge risk. Unless you take that risk. And keep your day jobs.
1659942274.0-1659950118.0
I think that's the advice. Yeah, that's the advice. That's clearly the advice. This is again I'm quoting Mr. Junjun vala.
1659950134.0-1659972434.0
This is not something he has said. He said, look, if I can make 15% annually, I'm a thing. 15% annually. 15% probably it would take you till about six years to roughly six years plus to double your money. Okay?
1659972552.0-1659989606.0
And this is the biggest investor speaking, because over a period of time, everything normalizes. He said, If I can make 15% a year, I'll be an emperor. If I can make 21% a year, right? At 21%, you can double your money in five years. But typically, when people come here to the market, they want to double their money in a year.
1659989628.0-1659998358.0
Because that's the story. That's the narrative. They have been fed up. Okay? So if you were to kind of fine tune that rule.
1659998534.0-1660022030.0
You should say that, look, I get 5% as my Ft rate, but that's not good enough. If somehow I can get five percentage points more about that, I should be happy. So if it is like if the rates are 3%, probably I should be at 5% at 8%, at 8%, something like that. So you may still there's a good chance that you will be reasonable. You have reasonable expectations.
1660022110.0-1660036134.0
You'll end up making good money, decent money. And you never know, you might come across that multibagger which will just rocket someday. But if you're coming in with this thing, okay, in two years I need to double my I'm reading this headlines nifty at Record high sense, etc. Record high. Yes.
1660036172.0-1660051100.0
This is when everything is shining good. That unfortunately is the wrong approach, but that is how it always works in the market. People don't start investing until they see those headlines. Although now, Tanya, it's changing a little bit.
1660053310.0-1660072546.0
Mutual fund also have a long track record to show that, let's say you were invested for the last ten years. You would have kind of trebled your money by now. That awareness is there. Plus the fact that now fixed income instruments are not giving all that good returns. At least that was the feeling till some time back.
1660072648.0-1660095370.0
But the world has suddenly changed. Having the US Federal Reserve hiking rates, you're having all central banks, we don't know if they can move into a high interest rate. Retail income instruments become very attractive. But till that happens, I think a lot of money will continue to come flow into equity funds because that is still the asset which at this point is offering the best returns. Right?
1660095520.0-1660123330.0
Okay. So given that you've chronicled the history of stock markets, tell me what you think are the three or four largest developments that have brought Indian stock markets to where it is today. And this could be technological, it could be regulatory, it could be just the number of people who have now become financial investors. What do you think are the large events? Top of the head, I would say.
1660123480.0-1660139046.0
Clearly the entry of NSE. Until then it was a monopoly market. Monopoly is never good for the consumers. And that was the case when BSE was the only game in town. Of course there was a lot of right.
1660139068.0-1660151786.0
But then, now NSE is a monopoly. Effectively a monopoly in a way for many small stocks. Still, BSE is the go to platform. Yes, I take the point. Fair enough.
1660151808.0-1660181966.0
Tanya, NSE is kind of a monopoly, but you're talking about a complete lack of transparency at that point in time, in the days of open out crisis. So one is the moment NSE came, it introduced screen based trading. It started off with screen based trading, whereas BSE was very slow to move on. That for the simple reason that it would offer more transparency. A lot of brokers made money by not disclosing the rates, the proper rates at which they bought or sold for the client.
1660181998.0-1660214366.0
So if they would buy shares, they would kind of always mark it up a bit so that they could get to keep the difference. Reverse was the case while selling they would not give the all that changed when you had screen based trading with the NSC. So after that, that was clearly one big thing. Secondly was the advent of NSDL from physical to electronic shares. That was a major sea change.
1660214548.0-1660250826.0
That's another one which I feel was a major development at that point in time because also it stopped the menace of fake fourth shares because one of the reason many investors were not willing to come into the market because the whole process was quite tedious. Then you have the shrinking of the settlement system. It used to be seven day settlement system, actually five trading working days, but it used to be a week monday to Friday on BSE, wednesday to Tuesday on the NSE. That has shrunk. The Sno market has become very big.
1660250928.0-1660298522.0
The emergence of the equity derivatives market from 2002 to today where it has to the level that it has grown. So it's one of the most liquid markets. So these are some of the big changes that very quickly come to mind. But I must add here that brokers have another way of looking at it is like some brokers say that before shares were went electronic, when they were in the physical form, retail investors would hold those shares for a long time because it was a lot of trouble getting them getting them transferred and all those things. But with the change when you could just have those shares credited to your account quickly, you would not think for selling it off quickly.
1660298576.0-1660321122.0
So a lot of the mindset became very short term in that sense. Of course I think that's true. Yeah. This is a very minor thing. You can't miss the bigger picture there, which is that it made a big difference, it brought in transparency, it made the process because till then on the clearing houses there would be trucks backed up there, the physical shares coming from all over.
1660321176.0-1660333720.0
Then you need to manually sort it and it was really wonder how it went on for so long. Okay, and in terms of regulation, what do you think?
1660335850.0-1660358270.0
Disclosures what a role has sebi played? Teller role, no doubt about that. And regulations are an ongoing process. You can't start on day one saying that look, there's a set of rules and now this is the way it's going to be. They evolve because you come across new situations, special situations, then regulations have to be further tweaked.
1660358850.0-1660387654.0
Sometimes it's for the better, sometimes it makes it more cumbersome for the players involved. A lot of traders brokers today say that they are suffering from too much of compliance at this point. But that's again debatable. So for instance, here, let's say, let's take the instance of the margins which need to be put up by investors before they trade, okay? Now at least till 2001, you know, the broker would say, okay, no problem, you pay me whenever you can.
1660387692.0-1660408718.0
I'll take them, I'll do the trade. In fact, that approach also bankrupted a lot of brokers. Because what happens is when the settlement happens, the money first goes from the broker's account. Now when the broker tells the investor, okay, you pay me later, he's confident that the investor will pay him. But what if that trader or investor doesn't pay?
1660408804.0-1660441462.0
Doesn't that used to be and because there were no regulations on collection of margins were so lapse, it also led to a lot of over speculation because it was very easy today, now it becomes so strict, right? Unless the trader says that look, I have this money, the broker will not take. The broker can't put his capital there to fund the trader. If he's doing that, there are other mechanisms for that. But you can't just say, okay, just come over.
1660441516.0-1660461466.0
You can't just flip Proc book and climb, right? Also sees whether the money into the broker's account has actually come from the client's account. They're able to talk a lot of things. They're able to see if margins have been collected on time. Plus there used to be a lot of circular trading back then that has come down, obviously the regulation.
1660461498.0-1660479934.0
But it's like a cat and mouse game, right? You can't fix everything. New set of rules come into place. The ones who want to break rules, they'll find some other way out. So for instance, in 2099, 2000, a lot of companies openly they were manipulating their stock.
1660479982.0-1660503722.0
They had their NBFCs and through that NBFCs they would fund the broker who would jack up the prices. It was very openly done. Now there are regulations in place that's no longer easy. So what do you do? You take your money abroad, deployed with some fund house who will create a special bank and invest in only the stocks that you tell him there's no way of.
1660503776.0-1660517600.0
So on the face of it, it could be some foreign fund, the Mauritius subsidiary, but behind the scenes it would be a company or a broker. Okay.
1660521270.0-1660526050.0
You can only so much that also regulates so much because you make. Any number of rules.
1660528390.0-1660569620.0
Okay? I was also wondering when you look at the future of stock markets now we've looked at for instance, startups that have listed recently a lot of them through the evolution of these startups, you've seen them being hailed as the new business face of India. But once they reach the stock markets, they don't have often don't have the maturity to handle being part of the stock market regime in terms of financial reporting, in terms of responsiveness to investors. What do you make of that? What do you think of startups who have listed recently who feel like they're doing their investors a favor?
1660571670.0-1660598154.0
It again, depends. I wouldn't want to pass judgment on any of them. Now see, as far as the compliance part goes, it's not just startups. Many companies also try to get around that rule. There's something as following the law in letter and letters that's possible with both startups as well as some of the companies which have been listed for that.
1660598352.0-1660625570.0
I'm not playing or probably I'm playing a devil's advocate here. If you look at many of these startups, probably they are also under pressure from their set of investors to exit. And whenever a company wants to get listed, they will always seek maximum valuations. Right? They will always go for the maximum valuation.
1660626870.0-1660634360.0
So at that point in time, the market was quite hot.
1660637530.0-1660660422.0
All those valuations were lofty. They didn't make sense. I mean, if anybody did their homework, they would know that many of them are loss making. Nearly all of them were loss making and there is no way that you'll be seeing any kind of profits for the next many years. And still they are asking for a fancy price.
1660660496.0-1660685782.0
But the market was willing to see ultimately the shoe is priced at whatever the market is willing to bear. And at that point in time, market was willing to bear those prices. And in a few cases, if you see now Zomato is is from 78 or 76 for the issue price down to 40. But there was a time when it went all the way from 76 to about 160 odd, right. Certain set of investors did make a lot of money on that.
1660685836.0-1660703642.0
Also, there nobody really got Nica people investors. Nica did well initially and still I. Think it's still above the issue price. I didn't check it last, but I think it's still about the issue price. Few of them have done well.
1660703776.0-1660736198.0
See, it's ultimately trying to figure out what the risk reward ratio there is. A lot of people don't look into the pricing so closely. They just look at, okay, this is a number, maybe this number will double. Okay, right. They don't understand what the business company see, ten years back, probably you couldn't blame investors because the information was not so freely available.
1660736364.0-1660740870.0
Today, even investor is willing to take a little bit of effort.
1660742890.0-1660776018.0
He has probably all the information, at least publicly available information that it's easy to come by. Plus there are so many websites where you get all the data, you can create your own filter. There's so much information available. So if you are willing to work towards that, there's a chance that you'll make mistakes, no doubt, but you will have an idea of what you're doing. For most people, most people investing in mutual funds don't know how it works.
1660776104.0-1660808830.0
They just go in there and they've seen those campaigns and they say, okay, they just. Look at the returns, no reversion to mean nothing because if you go back in time you will find that, you know, the returns tend to moderate but mutual fund houses will also show the best. You know, they'll cherry pick and say that in this five years people would have like for instance, if you had invested in March of 2020, in any mutual fund you're sitting on almost two times the money but that will moderate as you go forward. But that's the story that's sold. So this market purely works on stories.
1660809490.0-1660825860.0
What is the story? The stock is up, there's a story to it crashes, there's a different story to it. Stories just keep changing. The third task for the investor is to actually know where the reality is. Have at least a rough idea of that.
1660827110.0-1660841314.0
Okay? Yeah. So tell me about what do you think looking ahead, what do you think are changes that probably should come to the stock market? Do you think we're on par globally? We're fairly regulated.
1660841362.0-1660866026.0
I mean it's hard to say what changes. I mean there's nothing pressing. Of course many of the rules can be fine tuned but if you say we are very much there, we rank along the best globally. So hard to say if we need anything very urgently at this point. A lot of little changes can happen but they are all on the margins.
1660866138.0-1660867600.0
They're all on the margin. Okay.
1660870070.0-1660931060.0
You come to the point about information and the sort of primacy given to having information in the market and having it before everybody else. And if you look at the largest stock market scandals, for instance, it's all about who has access to information, how they've acted, other information, even, even the most recent NSE colocation scam. It's it's how some people have priority access to information and orders, how they've taken advantage of it, who was involved at the exchange, which sort of facilitated this. Do you think it's always going to be an unfair game? That there will always be some people who will have primary access to that information, who will take advantage and the rest of us will sort of operate in a world that is not as rarefied as that?
1660931670.0-1660969546.0
Well, information asymmetry will always be dertanya. I can't see a situation where you can say that it's a very fair place. If it is that the case, then probably there'll be very little opportunity to profit because if everything is discovered in the price, right, prices often move because of the or they largely move because of information, asymmetry now Moran does. Let's say a company is negotiating with another for a big order, right? It manages to get that, okay, now let's say they always get a hint from their customer that okay, we are going to give this order to you.
1660969588.0-1660993942.0
In principle we are fine, let's drop the agreement and other things next week, but we are okay. So you started work and all that thing. And now the company which received the order, it's up to the company when it wants to disclose to the stock exchange. It can say that okay, I will do it right away. But then technically it's just an in principle thing.
1660993996.0-1661004860.0
But people within the company will know, some set of people. Otherwise the people at the customers end will know that this company is going to get the order. Right? Yeah.
1661008830.0-1661010460.0
So this is just one example.
1661013090.0-1661029298.0
There will always be some set of investors with an edge. Now it depends whether they want to use that or not use that. It all boils down to that. So information, a short answer to your question. Information asymmetry will always be there.
1661029464.0-1661046778.0
Right. But then there are some with the example of NSC, for instance, the Colocation scam. What happened was that the institution itself was facilitating this. Well, that's a bit of a okay. At this point the probe is there are many facets to that whole thing.
1661046864.0-1661071050.0
One is that the Colocation thing was that part was legal. That brokers couldn't that much was legal. Now according to Sevi, the people at the top should have known what was happening. They didn't know. Now we still don't know at this stage whether it was a case of omission or commission.
1661071130.0-1661091490.0
Commission, right. We can't stay till the investigative agencies come to. Was it a set of people acting on their own? We don't know at this point in time. But suffice to say that probably a lot of loopholes or shortcomings in the system were exploited.
1661091570.0-1661106560.0
Well, in some cases, like for instance, many brokers accessed the secondary server when they were warned not to. But at that point there was no penalty for that. They could just be warned. So there are a lot of gray areas. Okay.
1661107170.0-1661123186.0
Some people benefited for sure. There's little doubt from whatever has come out. And whatever we have read, it's evident that some people had an unfair advantage. How did that come through? Was it with the exchange itself actively facilitating that?
1661123208.0-1661159210.0
Or was it a set of people who were acting on their own? That is not sure. But there's again an instance of how certain how systems can be gained. Okay. When you look at past scandals in the stock markets, there is always an immediate shock reaction to when there is, for instance, a story in the media that this instance has happened and you don't know the extent to which the extent of the scam you don't know the extent of loss to a potential notional loss to investors.
1661159370.0-1661217390.0
And I think this is true of the NDC colocation scam where there is still some sort of confusion about what exactly happened, what is the damage to people, to investors, to the regulatory environment. But my question is, do you think that these stories of these reports of scams, to the extent that it captures the imagination of the investor, that they lose trust in the system. It's happened in 91, 92, it's happened again in 99, 2000 for some time probably, I think how do I put it? No easy answers to this one, but I think over time, people tend to overcome. So for some time after this, prices crashed.
1661218390.0-1661238520.0
People lose faith in the system when they lose money as well along with it. That's what I think. Right after the Harsher metascam got exposed, stock prices crashed, a lot of people lost money. And then for a while, if you speak to anybody who invested in the 19%, there's a rigged game and I don't want to be part of it. I've lost a lot of money.
1661239930.0-1661274194.0
Well, it was perfectly fine as long as he was making money. But the moment you lose money, then it becomes a very rigged system. That said, the NSE Colocation Scam, for instance, yes, to some extent it would have not seen, it would not have led to erosion of trust, for sure. But a lot also depends on the overall market sentiment, market conditions, right? If the market conditions are ripe, like, you see the kind of money that is flowing into mutual funds at this point in month after month.
1661274232.0-1661312954.0
This despite the fact that foreign institutional investors have been very heavy sellers. Month alone they've sold Rs2 trillion worth of shares. But if you look at retail investors, the money from that said liquidity domestic money flow seems to be very strong at this point. So hard to say if people lose money, then that's where kind of and there's reason to show that it was done because they were treated unfairly, then maybe you could have that, but otherwise. I don't really think overall, it's not damaged.
1661313082.0-1661341734.0
Trusted people pick up the pieces. I mean, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but people tend to overcome these things pretty fast. Okay, and do you think there's a reevaluation of what exactly the Scams were and how they played out recently? There's a website, I'm sure you've seen it a bit. It's written by Hershad Mehta's widow, who's done this revaluation of all the scandals that have been attached to the family's name.
1661341772.0-1661344730.0
And they're saying a lot of this was untrue.
1661347150.0-1661348620.0
What more do you think of that?
1661353470.0-1661359360.0
Well, I would say that I've not read end to end.
1661362290.0-1661398970.0
It's like, okay, passing judgment on someone. See, whenever someone is caught, right, there's always a difference that I didn't do anything wrong at all. Now, certain things can be explained on technical things. Now to some extent, Harsher could have had technical grounds because that was the way system was. The whole scam came about because the rules were very rigid and what Hashed did again was not a novelty because if you go through the JPC report, it's very clearly stated that in the past there were banks, and especially foreign banks were doing the same thing.
1661399120.0-1661430754.0
Now, does that mean that Hashad was a victim of the system? No, I wouldn't say that either. Right. There were excesses very clearly, the whole bank receipt thing, that was one of the areas where a lot of scams, a lot of these irregularities happened. And then this whole rule that there was no system of this account, even if it was, you could still transfer the funds into your own account.
1661430872.0-1661467040.0
So it's not to say that there were no irregularities, to say that he didn't do anything wrong at all, that is definitely not the case. But then to say that he was the kingpin and he was the only guy who did everything wrong is also not the correct. Okay, we're in our last few minutes on the show. So we've looked at the past of the stock market and development. When you look at the future, are there things that you foresee as.
1661469990.0-1661493900.0
Will. Be major developments that will come? If you look at things like the idea of what is investment itself is not changing. When you look at Bitcoin is an investment or NFT is an investment to people of a previous generation. And to me, I don't know how you attach value to something like that.
1661496030.0-1661510320.0
Do you think there's going to be a wholesale change in the idea of what is money? How do we make money? How do we make our money grow? Do you think that's something that's going. To happen as of now?
1661511650.0-1661544630.0
Equity, clearly when you look over long periods of time, it is one of the asset classes that has given the best returns compared to some of the other and other asset classes like gold, real estate. There's also the ease of transaction. So it has many things going for it. Till about a year back, there was this very strong feeling that equity is so passing, it is crypto and all those instruments which are now the future. Right.
1661544780.0-1661573470.0
Equity is just over. And even if you now see and you see the correction in stock markets, the bigger connection, the erosion of wealth has been in the cryptocurrency market. Not really that. So it did catch popular imagination and very natural that happens if you look at the history of financial speculation. You had the tulip mania, plenty of railroad mania, then you've had waterways mania.
1661573550.0-1661583780.0
There have been so many of them. So this probably will like in 99, 2000, you had the.com boom. That was still equity in a sense.
1661588070.0-1661622658.0
We now look at on a website that all you can see is its utilities as a picture and it has sometimes more value than produced goods. So people had written off the internet in some ways after the 2000, it was hyped and nothing ever is going to come off it. And this was just a kind of a scam to pedal stocks and all that. But if you look the number of companies which emerged from the ruins and came up with very credible business models. There are quite a few of them today.
1661622824.0-1661646760.0
20 years on, the technology has really changed life. I would say at this point in time, as far as cryptocurrency is concerned, blockchain technologies, what seems to be missing is the application in real world. We talk about fancy terms and all that, but the bigger question is what are its real world applications? At this point, they don't seem to be many. How it will evolve, one can't say.
1661647210.0-1661662558.0
And will the linkages then be to the equity market? Will it be a blockchain technology firm which will go public and make a lot of money for investors? Well, we don't know that. Or will it be something very different? Will investing itself change?
1661662644.0-1661688790.0
Right now there's been intermediate. This intermediation intermediate is being done away with almost in every field, many fields except the stock market where you still need a broker broker to go through that. To that extent, this intermediation has not happened, to the extent that you're seeing in some of the other sectors. Okay, will that change? That's interesting.
1661688860.0-1661706558.0
So do you think the distributed ledger system is going to change how stock? No. I can't see the future, Tanya, but strange things have happened. So I would say that just about anything is possible. Okay, and last question.
1661706724.0-1661720334.0
You've been faithfully recorded the stock markets all the way all through your career. What what are your investments like? Where do you invest? What is equity? When investing, where you put your money.
1661720532.0-1661755110.0
In equity, and which is one, you'll be very surprised to know that it it's a very minuscule portion of my overall. It's only in recent years that I've actually started looking at equities very closely. I made my first mutual fund purchase just about four years back. Okay, that recent. Now the reason for this is that when you track something very closely, you are exposed to the good as well as the bad.
1661755280.0-1661788520.0
And in my case, when you see how things run, it's like being in the kitchen of a reputed restaurant. But when you went in the kitchen, you saw that the cooks are allowed either. Rats are running all over, and yet the people tend to appreciate that. So those who don't see the kitchen, they're having a good time eating the food. But you've seen what is happening there and now you don't feel like it took me a long time for that.
1661790810.0-1661816954.0
Very close to the market. That's the drawback. And I've seen that many of my friends who don't understand any of this instrument, but they've made lots of money. I completely sympathize because I have people who ask me, who ask me I invest only in virtual funds and not stocks directly because sometimes I feel like if I track a company too closely, I know everything that can go along. And I know that the risks of some of these risks can be catastrophic.
1661817082.0-1661830440.0
Right? So you're like I don't want to put my money there. It could be good but also could go to a bad thing. And my friends are also disappointed. What's the point of having a business journalist as a friend to us?
1661831290.0-1661837510.0
That's why I realized the meaning of the phrase step back and try to see the big picture.
1661839530.0-1661844440.0
Anyway, thank you so much. It's a pleasure having you on here.
1661847850.0-1661866766.0
We can have you again in the future, but everybody is watching. Thanks for joining us in Kuki and I hope you'll also have continue having such conversations on our platform. And Cynthia, I hope you will continue using coldcape and we hope to see you around again in the future. Thank you so much for your time and have a great evening. Thank you.
1661866788.0-1661869834.0
Tania thank you. It's a pleasure. Bye.

How a transition to a circular economy can become essential for public and private sectors. The Indian government said in a press note that the need of the R is a development model that leads to the optimalization of resources.

India's electricity sector is very heavily reliant on coal. 73% of India's electricity comes from coal. India has very ambitious renewable energy targets. Solar and wind power compared to coal is going to be cheaper in the future. India needs to get as close as possible to its renewable sites and then find mechanisms to actually reduce the coal generation. The government needs to find ways. to incentivize people to use the Navy, says Ashi Prayer. Circularity is about designing in a way that there is no waste, he says.

The first step to circularity is to start having your collection systems in a way where you are having that segregated streets.

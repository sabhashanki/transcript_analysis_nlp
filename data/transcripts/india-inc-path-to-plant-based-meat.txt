So hello and welcome to another Indian roundtable on Kilke. And today we'll be talking about something that I personally am really, really excited to know more about and also understand the sort of market it has in India right now. We will speak with social visits from Bluetrid Foods today and Sohail and I are going to be talking about the plant based protein market in India. We'll talk about his work with Blue Trip Foods and we'll also take a deeper look at what's driving the market right now and also what's holding it back. So if we are all set on the tech side of it, let's jump into some questions.
1653100810.0-1653121680.0
Yeah. Do you want to start off by telling me a bit about Blue Trip Foods and how has the journey been so far for you in this market? Sure. So, Blue Dried Foods, which essentially bringing plant based meat to the Indian taste palette or to the Indian cooking. Right.
1653122210.0-1653145154.0
There are plenty of plant based meat companies in Western markets, especially in Europe and in the US. But most of them cater to the tastes, the tastes and likings of those markets. And essentially all of them, at least most of them, started off with making beef and crops, which is obviously the meat of choice in the west. Right. Because we wanted to bring it to India.
1653145202.0-1653170160.0
So we kind of had to reinvent what plant based meat or what meat means to Indians. Right. It's mostly chicken and Indians consume meat in a variety of ways and which is why we wanted to bring in something which appealed to the Indian taste palate and appealed to the Indian market. So that's where we are. So blue dried Foods is plant based meat for India and for the Indian market.
1653171490.0-1653198470.0
It's been a couple of years since we started off. We started off in End in December 2020 and it's been about a year and a half since we've been in market. We spent about a year before that doing RND. Currently we've got about eight products launched. We are present in 15 cities directly and another five or six through distributors and retailer partners.
1653199210.0-1653232962.0
And it's been an encouraging response so far. We've understood that there is a need for products like this. I think one of our biggest surprises was that a lot of non vegetable consumers have actually taken plant based meat as an addition to their diet. And replacing people who are, say, eating non vegetable four to five times a week are the ones who are replacing one or two of those use cases with plant based meat, especially as a snack. Over the last couple of years.
1653233016.0-1653271738.0
I think that's what RT learning as well. And that's what we're going to keep trying to focus on, to give non vegetarians more use cases, more ways to use plant based meals in their existing cuisines, in their existing sort of lifestyle, and hopefully in that effect, reduce the amount of meat that is overall being consumed by India as a country. Can you tell us a bit about what is the meat actually made of here? Because there are so many different compositions for plant based meat, we see. So essentially plant based meat.
1653271834.0-1653320670.0
So I'll talk a little bit about the context and the concept of plant based meat and then go down to the details of how we are making it or how other companies are also making it. Right. Plant based meat essentially means that you're trying to provide products which are going to taste, feel, look like meat, right? If you take chicken or if you take butter nor beef or fish as an example, at the base of it, it's a combination of proteins and fats which you get from which you get from various sources, right? From any of these kind of sources, what plantbased meat aims to do is replicate the properties of the proteins and fats so that when we as humans consume it, we get the same experience as what we would have got while consuming it from an animal.
1653321970.0-1653344034.0
And that's the underlying concept for making plant based. You got to make products which, at the molecular level, are replicating animal based proteins and animal based fats. Right? Now, a lot of companies do a lot of different things in this. Plant based meat is but one alternative to animal meat.
1653344162.0-1653373630.0
There's also fermentation based meats or mushroom based meats, wherein you get the same texture and taste from other places as well, like mushrooms. And by fermentation. Of plant based sources, you also have an alternative which is very new, which is called cultivated meat, which is basically you're growing the meat in a lab, right? Of all of these, currently, the most economically viable and widespread is the plant based meat. Now, plant based meat comes from a variety of plant based sources.
1653373970.0-1653415838.0
The idea is to give as many amino acids or essential amino acids as meat provides. The most popular sources currently are soy protein and pea protein, although there are companies in India which are looking at even more indigenous sources of protein, like Amran or like moon beans and stuff like that. But currently, at least for Blue Tribe, we use soy peak as the basis of our proteins, and we are also looking into other proteins to provide the same kind of properties and texture. But currently, these are the two that we are using in our products. Okay.
1653416004.0-1653447142.0
Is the nutritional value somewhere comparable to animal meat for the same amount of meat? So that's an interesting question. Actually, a lot of people come back to us saying that, hey, you know what? Your chicken nuggets have so little protein as compared to, say, chicken, right? But I would say you've got to compare it like to, like so, for example, if you're comparing chicken or chicken nuggets versus actual animal chicken nuggets, therein you will find the similarity in the amount of protein that you're getting, right?
1653447196.0-1653480750.0
For example, let me give you an example of something which is not a fried or a snack kind of product. Take chicken mince, for example. If you take chicken mints from an animal, you would get about 20 grams per 20 grams of protein per 100 grams of the mince. With plant based chicken heima that we provide, you get about 18 grams of protein per 100 grams of that chicken heima. So what we're trying to do is replicate each product right down to the nutritional value of what you would have bought from animal meat, but giving it to you through plant based sources.
1653480830.0-1653529700.0
In fact, while these are the macros, this is what the macros look like even at a micronutrient level for something like vitamin B twelve, which is essentially something that a lot of vegetarians have problems in assimilating into their body because vitamin B twelve sources in the vegetarian world are a little lower. Right. But what we are doing is we found vegetarian than the plant based sources of vitamin B Twelve as well. And we're incorporating that also into the meat, into the meat that we make. So essentially giving you not just the taste and the experience, but also the there is still a little way to go in some of the meats, but I think with technology improving at the rated it is, I think it will get there.
1653530310.0-1653561334.0
Plant based meat also is also better than animal meat in a couple of ways. One is that there is no cholesterol which you get in plant based meat. Cholesterol as a molecule essentially only comes from animal based sources. So either from meat or from dairy, right, or eggs, obviously. But with plant based meat you will not get any cholesterol in the product inherently because there is cholesterol as those plants don't have a source of cholesterol.
1653561382.0-1653585502.0
In that sense, you also get a lot more fiber, which is essential for good digestion. And working off your internal digestive processes, you will get a lot more fiber. You won't get any cholesterol with plant based meat. But yeah, there are some places we might be off by about a couple of percentage points in terms of the protein that we are providing. But it's a work in progress.
1653585566.0-1653611500.0
I think it will get there in the next year or so. Then it's pretty comparable to animal meat for that. I mean, for a technology that's so new. But I have always wondered about the target market for plant based meat. I mean, you have your nonvegetarians and you're trying to get them to replace the animal meat, but are you also trying to get the vegetarians to adopt this as a new source of protein for them?
1653612350.0-1653649000.0
So plant based meat as a concept or as a purpose is aimed at reducing meat consumption. Now, the reason to reduce meat consumption are varied, right? You've got it could be one of three reasons, or a combination of the three? The main three reasons are one is the ethics of it of, you know, having to kill about at last count, I think, if I remember the numbers correctly, we're killing about 80 billion animals a year in order to build the population of humans, which is about 8 billion, which in effect is a very inefficient sort of protein delivery mechanism in that sense. Right.
1653649450.0-1653684946.0
The other reason could be the planetary impact of it now plant based. So in terms of land, let me boil that down the plan. Let me boil the planetary impact down to land, water and also greenhouse gases. In terms of land, about 70% of the farmland that is currently under cultivation is being used to grow food for animals which we are then consuming. And we are only getting and humans are only getting about 20% of their calories from those animals, which means 70% of our farmland is contributing to only 20% of the calories that humans are getting.
1653685048.0-1653722190.0
Now, imagine if we were to replace that 70% farmland with growing more vegetables, more protein sources, which can directly be given to humans without having to go through this middleman or this middle animal in that case, right. It would become a lot more efficient. You would have to you can really cut down on the amount of farmland that you need, and we don't need to keep expanding into rainforests and threaten those ecosystems to be able to feed the planet. Right. Similarly, in water use, you require about 70% less water to give you 1 gram or one kg of plant based meat, as compared to giving you one kg of animal meat.
1653722530.0-1653739480.0
So, again, freshwater, which is, again a resource which is going to be in a huge scarcity in the future, is something that can be the risk of that can be abated by shifting to a more plant forward lifestyle. The third is greenhouse gases. Now plant based.
1653741690.0-1653768560.0
The level at which animal agriculture currently happens in the world contributes to about 15% of the greenhouse gases released by humans into the atmosphere. Right. And as we know, the greenhouse gases that are being released into the atmosphere are contributing towards climate change, are contributing towards bombing at the poles. We're already seeing the adverse effects of climate change in a lot of places. Right.
1653769810.0-1653776320.0
If you've been anywhere in India over the last month, you know that the heat wave has really been taking us over. Right.
1653780850.0-1653793234.0
It's just insane. Right. And these heat waves or these abnormal climate events are only going to get more frequent. We're seeing a lot more reports of floods. We're seeing a lot more reports of glaciers breaking.
1653793282.0-1653813054.0
We are seeing a lot more reports of abnormal rains. So climate change is real that it's upon us. I mean, there's no point we have to find solutions for it. I think that is where plant based meat kind of kind of comes in, right? You're trying to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas that are released, which in turn then reduce the impact of climate change.
1653813092.0-1653867834.0
I think most of the experts who talk about climate change as a subject, including one of my personal heroes, Richard Attenborough, who's renowned history and renowned biologist, recently said in one of his Netflix specials that the one single way that every human can contribute towards reducing their impact on climate change is move to a more plant forward diet. So that's where plant based meat kind of fits in, right? What we're trying to reduce is meat from the environment or from the consumption. And hence the target audience for plant based meat and for all the companies that are working in this ecosystem becomes the non vegetarians. The way that we define our target audience internally for Blue Tribe is non vegetarians with a conscience.
1653867962.0-1653893270.0
I know it's a very vague way of determining it, but essentially what we're trying to say is that we are meant for non vegetarians, for people who really love the taste of meat, who have been eating it for a while. So they don't want to compromise on the taste, but they do understand that there is an impact associated with eating that meat. That impact could be your own health. It could be on the planet. It could be the ethics of the animals also.
1653893420.0-1653916694.0
Ethics of animals. That said also, that's the kind of audience that we go to and tell them that, hey, you know what? You love the taste of meat, but you know that there is an impact associated with it. Here's something that you don't need to compromise on your taste or your experience of consuming meat and you can just shift over maybe a couple of meals a week. And that itself contributes to a huge, huge reduction.
1653916742.0-1653953080.0
If 7 billion of us or at 1.2 billion of us in India to it, it's massive, right? Yeah, definitely. This is like the most sustainable production of any sort of meat that we have right now. But there is this argument that I often get when we talk about plant based meat is that isn't it more environmentally friendly to say, consume meat from a poultry beside my house than to have plant based meat and other fruits and vegetables flown in from different city or imported from a different country? Isn't that environmentally more friendly than this?
1653954590.0-1653965180.0
Firstly, the plant based meat that we are manufacturing is within India only. It's not within. There is no climate impact of having it flown in from anywhere else or something like that.
1653967230.0-1653989300.0
Okay, let me put it this way. The poultry farms that we are currently getting meat from, at least in the metro cities of the country, are not coming from our own, from our own neighborhood. Right. There are poultry farms where there are millions and millions of chickens which are happening, which are in the hinterlands of the country, in the farmlands of the country. So the real impact is felt there.
1653990470.0-1654014090.0
If you reduce the demand, then the supply can be allowed to become more sustainable, because those chickens that you're seeing in your neighborhood shop are not being grown there. Right. They're coming in from elsewhere. So I don't think that the logic holds very true when you understand where the chickens are being grown and the volumes at which this is taking place. Right.
1654014160.0-1654031460.0
Like I said, 80 billion land animals a year is basically ten times the population of humans being killed every year. And I'm not even counting, like, fish and eggs and all of that. I'm just counting land animals, which is like chickens, cows, boats, stuff like that.
1654034710.0-1654061322.0
So right now, the target market is basically the non vegetarian population, and as many of them you can get to replace animal needs. So is it any type? Are you looking to shift to the vegetarian population as well? Because India has a sizable vegetarian population, especially in the west and northwest of the country. But one thing that comes to mind when I talk about vegetarian feeding plant based meat is that they won't like it.
1654061376.0-1654080802.0
It's supposed to imitate the taste of meat for us who would eat meat. We would like the taste, but they wouldn't, even though they know it comes from plants. Yeah, I think you've answered it as well as I could have. Essentially, like I said, it's meant for non vegetarians who know the taste of meat. Right.
1654080936.0-1654105574.0
Most vegetarians don't know the taste of meat and don't have a curiosity to know that either. Right. If there are curious vegetarians who want to try it out without having to put it onto their conscience that, hey, I'm eating a Hannibal. Very welcome to do so. But I think the main impact that will be fed will be with the non vegetarians, where the meat consumption is actually being reduced by converting it to plant based meat.
1654105622.0-1654128670.0
Right. The vegetarians honestly are not really contributing towards this problem in that sense. Beyond the problem, doesn't that restrict the market for this plant based protein in India? Because compared to the other countries, say Western countries, meat consumption in India is comparatively lesser than Western countries?
1654130690.0-1654172526.0
I mean, as a on a per capita level, yes, it might be lesser, but if I remember my figures correctly, 70% of Indians identify themselves as non vegetarian, as opposed to what the gentle consensus is. And 70% of those while 70% of those identify as non vegetarians, there are about, I think, eight to 10% of Indians who eat meat on a daily basis. Right. And 40% of Indians are eating meat at least once a week. So because of the sheer population of India, while at a per capita level, we might be eating much lower meat per person than somebody sitting in the US.
1654172708.0-1654211206.0
But because of the aggregate level at which our population is at the huge population that we are at, those numbers account to a huge amount. In fact, in one of the reports that I was reading, india is probably going to be the third largest consumer of meat starting 2013 to 2015 and after that it will probably go to second. See, meat consumption. You also have to note that meat consumption increases in any country or any demographic income where your per capita income is increased. So as soon as you have a little bit of more disposable income on you, you start consuming a lot more meat.
1654211238.0-1654230260.0
At least that's been the trend for the last 50, 60 years. Right. And India being a developing nation, india being an economy that is growing by leaps and bounds every year or every decade, you're bound to see a lot more meat eaters getting into the population than moving out over the next 35 years.
1654234710.0-1654262940.0
Quite sufficient to drive the growth for the market. And especially if I could maybe pinpoint where we are trying to address this, if you look at the urban centers of the country, that's where a lot more meat is being consumed, right? People who live in urban centers have some disposable income, especially the younger, gently millennial sort of generation is where meat. Consists of their heating happens. Yeah.
1654263390.0-1654281026.0
So that's where meat has also been consumed. But these are the people who are also most concerned about the future of the planet because that's the planet that we have to live on. Right. So that's where I think this entire game is being played right now. You've got a lot more non vegetarians coming in.
1654281048.0-1654345954.0
But these non vegetarians also know their impact on the empire and hence would be a little bit more willing to switch over or at least be a meat reducer in a term that we use nowadays, who are actively who are actively looking to reduce the amount of heat that they're. Do. You see more sales in these orbits than just compared to the tier two. Cities or actually so I think our top cities for Bluetripe currently are Pompeii, Delhi, Bangalore, Akhuba, then Chennai. We also have some we also have some surprises on it, wherein like places like Chandigar Dera do really well, where again, I think there is a more evolved market in place and hence a more aware market in place where it is easy for people to understand the concept and make a conscious call towards reducing their meat consumption.
1654346002.0-1654372000.0
Right. I think over the next few years, see, climate change is not going away anytime soon. Everybody knows and everybody now has all the effects of climate change to see. Right? So what happens now is basically when they equate what are the causes of this and then start to do something to kind of mitigate that.
1654372370.0-1654385330.0
As more and more of this happens, I think a lot more people will be more aware about how plant based meat can fit into their lifestyle yet drive down their footprint or carbon footprint or their impact on the plant.
1654388150.0-1654414798.0
I am personally really interested to try plant based meat. I haven't been able to. One of the primary reasons I think I haven't been able to is I don't get it in my nearby Superstar. Like I have a moon near my house, I go there, but I do not see any plant based products there. So I feel like the access to those products is still mostly online or probably hiding store like a hypermarket somewhere, but not like your Mower or any supermarket near your house.
1654414884.0-1654441494.0
So I think that's where the market. Still has to grow there, at least for us. So More probably is not a place that we're presented right now, but most of the I think the way we started off is we started off in a direct to consumer sort of manner where you could automate our website and we deliver it to you. We also now are going to retail in a big way. So we are present with all of your gold made food chains, right?
1654441532.0-1654452360.0
Nature's basket. Modern bazaar Lamash in Delhi also. Simply, Namdari is in Bangalore. We're getting on board with Spencer, stuff. Like that as well.
1654452970.0-1654491090.0
We are also present with and I think that has been the game changer in this case as well. We are also present with a lot of quick delivery apps. So Swiggy and Smart, you can get plant based meat at your doorstep in 30 minutes, right? And since the time that we've been able to get here it's in Visa, reached by a huge amount because like you said correctly, that we are not present with all the retailers yet because it's been only about a year and a half that people in the market. But with guys like Swigging, some are coming in or with Amazon or Blinket all of these guys are now being able to increase our target population or reach population by huge amounts because they're not limited by the catchment areas next to their stores.
1654491690.0-1654533746.0
You can be sitting anywhere and not have any of these catchment stores in your vicinity, but yet get a sweetie and some are delivery in 30 minutes to you or a blanket delivery in like 40 minutes to you, so you can always order it from there now and I think that really helps. So the plan is to get into as many detailed chains as possible to. Make it absolutely at least into the chains that cater to the kind of audience that is most likely to pick up a plant based meat, right? So you would expect people who are walking into a nature's basket to do shopping to be more to be aware of plant based meat and also want to try it out. So that was actually our first retailer that we signed on.
1654533848.0-1654537890.0
Similarly with food hall. Similarly with lamarge, modern, bazaar.
1654540630.0-1654568160.0
Market. I mean, they're not really organic, but they cater to gourmet foods in that sense. Another big thing that people talk about when we talk about land based meal is the price point. I was checking on the website that there's a pack of twelve chicken momos that cost somewhere around 300, where an animal version of it would cost say, 150 or 180. Absolutely.
1654569010.0-1654595238.0
That jump is pretty big for urban eaters or people's mind. So you think that's becoming a roadblock right now for this market? Yeah, absolutely. So pricing is something that will come down, is currently a blocker for a lot of people because they won't consume it as often as they would have it paid a little bit cheaper. But I think people are still understanding that, hey, you know what?
1654595244.0-1654624590.0
I'm paying a premium for XYZ benefits. I'm paying a premium for low cholesterol, or I'm paying a premium for not having to kill an animal without compromising on my experience. Or I'm paying a premium for not impacting the environment as much as I would had I consumed an animalbased product. But yes, with scale, I think the pricing of these products will come down, especially in places like chicken, which is inherently a very cheap source of protein. At least in India.
1654627330.0-1654665370.0
It is quite expensive. It is more comparable. Obviously, we can't compare ourselves against fresh meat, but if you compare it to, say, the frozen islands of the supermarket, you'll find us at about a 1.5 to 1.6 sort of premium to plant to animal meat. In other meats, actually, like poke or mutton, we are fairly at the same price point because those products are inherently more expensive anyway for the animal meat section. But yeah, I think scale will be an important lever in order for us to become price, to have price parity with animal meat.
1654667630.0-1654689874.0
I'm not saying that it's going to happen immediately, but it will probably take a couple of years for us to get anywhere close to what chicken retails are. For the other meats, I think it's much simpler. There is a fairly new market in India right now and people are just getting to know about it. And I think that takes us to our next roadblock that I see. People are not aware of what sort of products there are or how many companies are providing this product.
1654689912.0-1654719040.0
I mean, I personally got to know when I started researching about it because I don't see ads as much as I see for lishes, for example, that gives me so do you think that the lack of awareness for these products is also like a major roadblock that you would have to go through? Yes, absolutely. For awareness, you've got to spend a lot of marketing dollars behind it to make people aware of the problem. I think there are a few companies now who are spending some dollars into getting this.
1654721890.0-1654763294.0
US being one, I would say there's about ten to twelve, about a dozen companies in the country which are doing something in this space. And obviously, we are the ones who are trying to create the category, create the awareness, and then hence create the category around it. Having, say, Virat Anderson on board for us as brand ambassadors has really helped us increase the amount of awareness for this kind of product or this category. I think that's going to do wonders over the next few years when we actually come out with ads with them as the face of it. I think that's when people will understand this, a lot more people will understand this category and the need for it.
1654763332.0-1654763920.0
Right.
1654771250.0-1654811302.0
Really excited to see it. Brings me to another question, is when we were talking about the lack of awareness and that each company would have to spend to market their own product, when I mean, adopting plant based meat should be like a conscious choice. And it's basically like the final target is to make it more advanced, friendly and sustainable. So do you think that this is a place for a government led initiative or a government led PR campaign to come in and sort of promote plant based heating? That is definitely not like a company specific, but a government led campaign to shift to a plant based eating?
1654811366.0-1654846406.0
Because we have several government food campaigns, like eat Rice or forgetting the names, but there are several government food campaigns that encourage us to eat more like a cleaner and a healthier diet. So do you think there sort of need to be a tie up there so that we can push it to push a more plant based diet towards the urban consumers? So I would say the government can play a role in two or three different ways. One is getting plant based meats on par with level the playing field between, say, plant based meat and meat. Right.
1654846428.0-1654887730.0
Currently, plant based meat is taxed at about 18%, according to GST versus meat, which is at 5%. Right. So immediately you've got a delta over there, which can be kind of done away with if the government does, to choose to sort of make this a more level playing field and if they are trying to promote it. The other big thing that actually the government could do, which I really strongly believe is the need of the hour, is to attract investment into these areas where India can actually become a hub for manufacturing of plant based meat. Because plant based meat, while in India it's only a couple of years old, has been around for five, six years in other countries and is really catching up speed.
1654890570.0-1654919790.0
The global market size for plant based meat is about $8 billion, if I'm not wrong. Right. And India being the source of a lot of those vegetarian proteins because we are growing them, if we can invest in the technology to actually extract the protein from there, I think we could become. One of the biggest exporters of plant based meat to the world. And that's something that obviously affects it's a win on two levels, right?
1654919860.0-1654963882.0
One, you're helping to reduce meat from the overall ecosystem, and you're also helping India as a country become a lot stronger in exports by creating a completely new category for exports, where in India could be the leader. In general, we are always like two, three years behind the times when it comes to newer practices or newer products in the world, and which gives time for other countries, other manufacturing led countries like, say, China, Bangladesh or Vietnam to kind of jump beyond us. Right. But I think this is a place, or this is the category where in India is pretty much up there with the rest of the world. We have some great products in the market, not just us, but competition as well.
1654964016.0-1654969680.0
And I think it's a great place for it to be sort of export hub as well.
1654971970.0-1654997702.0
That brings us two of the things that we can do. But I was also talking about sort of like a PR initiative, like, we have make in India, for example, that promotes Indian based companies. So some sort of like a PR campaign from the government to promote a cleaner plant based diet mostly. Do you think that's going to be helpful for the market or that would. Definitely be helpful for the market?
1654997836.0-1655016160.0
Yeah, it will definitely be helpful for the market. But, I mean, obviously, India also is a big india's second largest exporter of beef in the world, right. It also boils down to economics. Plant based meat is a very small part of the meat industry right now.
1655018690.0-1655045880.0
I don't know whether the government would want to compromise on that huge amount for promoting justice, but there are ways that it can level the playing field so that there is equal competition out there and then consumers can do their choosing. I think that would be a more apt way of putting it. Fair enough. So we have been talking about roadblocks still. You want to talk a little bit about what are the primary growth drivers for the market that you're seeing now?
1655046250.0-1655080754.0
We definitely see the ethics of eating animal meat as being like a pig, to have people move over to the plant based diet, mostly. So other than that, what do you see, like, the primary growth drivers to this market? I think the biggest growth driver is a lot more personal, and probably it has been the only silver lining of the pandemic. A lot more people have become aware of what they're putting into their bodies and where water is coming from. At the current industrial level that animals are being grown for meat, there's a lot of antibiotics and steroids which go into them.
1655080792.0-1655102330.0
Right. And if there is a bug which kind of jumps over that wall of antibiotics and steroids, it becomes a superbug, which can then harm humans as well in the last 100 years. I think four of the pandemics can be attributed towards animal farming. So Spanish flu back in 1990, avian fluid.
1655104990.0-1655124794.0
There was also swine fluid in 1415. And some people, most people attribute cobid also to some amount of animal interference. Right. It's coming from an animal to humans. These kind of things are going to become a lot more common because of the scale in which animals need to be grown, the time in which they need to be grown.
1655124842.0-1655148790.0
They have to be grown really quickly against their natural life cycle. Plant based meat in that sense is pretty clean. We're not putting in any antibiotics or steroids and stuff like that. There's no chance for a contamination like that happening or a superbug sort of emerging from there. So that has been one of the greatest drivers in terms of the awareness of what they're putting, of what people are eating.
1655149610.0-1655194114.0
I think second Driver is, like I mentioned before, awareness about climate change and its impact, which over the last five, six years or so has been felt by urban as well as semi urban India in a big way in the last decade or so. And not just India actually globally. And if you see flat based as a category in India, 2021 could be considered to be like an inflection year for it because the number of companies, the number of investments that came into this space in 2021 have been huge. And that's when the category actually got established. If we were having this call in 2019, I don't think anybody would have known what plantation meant.
1655194162.0-1655227886.0
Right. But there is still awareness that this category or this need exists. I think it's only a matter of time to get people to sample it out, and then once they're okay with the experience, they can include it as a part of their regular diet. How difficult do you think it's going to be to get let's just talk about urban population right now. How difficult do you think it is going to be to get them more conscious about the slaughterhouse situation or the whole ethics of killing an animal?
1655227998.0-1655248486.0
Because most people are pretty ignorant towards it, or pretty thick skin, for that matter, that animals are grown to be eaten. So let's let's see, that's what I usually hear or not. So how difficult is it going to be? I think you're right there. People are a little thick skin towards animal cruelty of that.
1655248508.0-1655277700.0
But there are other drawbacks of animal meat apart from just the ethics of it. Like I mentioned, health is one key drawback, which is a lot more personal to one than a separate animal, which they might or might not have any kind of empathy towards. Right. The planet as a whole is also a huge sort of hook to get people to understand what animal weight or the process of getting animal weight is doing to the planet. Right?
1655278790.0-1655325918.0
I think those will be the two key sort of drivers of growth for this industry. And also, I think the third key driver, which we keep mentioning, which we never mentioned, but probably is the hygiene factor, is innovation in the products and getting the products to be as close to meet as possible in terms of not just experience, but also price. So I think that there's a lot more research that is required over the next few years on getting better and better products out there at a much cheaper cost. There's a little bit of dilemma here that like you said, as it scales, we are going to see better price points in these products, but we are going to see better price points only when it scales. Sort of it's like they're both dependent on each other.
1655326004.0-1655359190.0
The more people buy it, when people will buy it more, when it becomes on par with meat, our frozen food section, so that becomes part of their daily diet. So how do we fix that? I don't think I understood your question. I'm saying that we were just talking about price points and he said as the market scales more, as the company, particularly this company scales more, we are going to see better price points for these products. But I mean, how do you expect it to scale more if people don't.
1655359270.0-1655386802.0
Adopt it and stopping them to adopt it incremental innovation. Obviously, price points are not going to come down by Rs50, certainly. Right. And demand isn't as what is gradual reduction in the disparity between chicken and plant based meat. You'll see prices of meat increasing at a much faster rate over the next few years.
1655386856.0-1655400360.0
So you will have that sort of price parity coming in by itself without us having to do much. Obviously, with more and more people shifting towards that, you will see our prices also going down or at least remaining same while the rest of the price will go up.
1655402650.0-1655439410.0
So I have one last question that I want to know is where do you see, like, in the next five years? Where do you see the market going? And also where do you see blue chi foods going in the next five years? So, in terms of the market, I would say plant based meat currently is a very small fraction of the meat market. I would hazard a guess to say that over the next five or six years, it would be between two to 3% of the overall meat market in the country right now, which sounds really small, but you have to understand that the meat market in the country is about 300,000 crores.
1655440710.0-1655463690.0
3% of that is a huge amount. Right. So I would say that's where it's going. I think the way to get there is to have more innovative products out there, to have more products which can be versatile because Indians don't use meat in one way, right. Maybe in the US or in the UK, you can get away with having one burger patty, and that cater to about 20% of the way that meat is being consumed.
1655464190.0-1655495240.0
In India, meat is consumed in a variety of things, so you've got to have products which can offer themselves up to that sort of variety, which you can use in, say, a kima, which you can use in the Garyani also, which you can use in a sharma also. There's so many different ways that we eat meat. Right. So I think that is the key to the Indian market. You've got to have products for as many use cases as possible out there so that consumers, if they're feeling like eating anything, they have a plant based meat alternative available for that.
1655495690.0-1655497320.0
I think that would be the key.
1655500970.0-1655528306.0
And that's where noodrive as a company is trying to get to see. So, in the next five years, I am personally expecting to see more television commercials and social media presence for Blue Drive suits and something else that you're planning for the next five weeks. Yeah, so, I mean, social media social media and commercials are hygiene. It's basically awareness building. But you will see a lot more products coming out there.
1655528328.0-1655564140.0
You will see a lot more pricing parity, hopefully, in the next five years, so that we can get to a point where consumers then don't need to think about the price, but just about, hey, do I want to kill an animal today for my chicken nuggets or not? And I think once you get there, nobody in their right mind would say that, no, I want to kill that animal for my chicken nuggets. If I'm getting the same experience, if it's at the same price, I think it just boils down to a modern choice, I would say.
1655566670.0-1655580778.0
Well, I think I'm the end of all the questions that I had so well and have a wonderful time talking to you. I'm definitely going to be trying. I've been dying to try it. Sometimes I get my hands. Back once you try it.
1655580964.0-1655593590.0
I'm sorry. I said, do let us know your feedback once you try it. Definitely. I think I love it, eating meat. Anyway, so I hope to see you back on our platform soon for more of these.
1655593660.0-1655605960.0
Absolutely, yeah. Love being here. I think you guys are doing a great job. This is a very novel concept. When I heard about it the first time, which is why I was very kicked about being here, to figure out how this works.
1655609530.0-1655616160.0
Different topics and things that we don't really see on the mail, stream media to have people come and talk about that.
1655618770.0-1655622938.0
All right, thank you so much, sir. Thank you. Bye.

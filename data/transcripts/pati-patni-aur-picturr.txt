1658502170.0-1658518560.0
We have Priyanka, we have full kids, it's a full house. Very excited. Thrilled. I think more excited is the audience who's joining in. I already started getting messages that why are you not logged in already?
1658519090.0-1658538306.0
High fuge. So all of the five of us five of us went for it's. The first show of the film, which I think five of us had been waiting for the last four years. It's an unbeed Kapoor film. Shamsheera last we saw Rambid in sandju.
1658538418.0-1658557550.0
And I think it's been a long, long wait for all of us. So I would not waste time and I just shoot the question to three of you. First thought? Yeah. What were your immediate thoughts when the credits started rolling?
1658558610.0-1658582998.0
And I think, Pulkit, you're on mute. I think we'll go to Priyanka, Prakar and Pulkit. Okay, so you're asking the first reaction, right? Your immediate thought when the credits when it's flashed, directed by Karan Maloka. See, first of all, I feel nothing.
1658583084.0-1658608382.0
Breaths. The joy of watching Ranveer Kapoor after four long years. I think I was so excited to just see him on screen, just see him act after so long that for me, he did justice to that. So my first reaction was, this is it. I've finally seen him act after four years.
1658608436.0-1658636470.0
And that is something so different. I mean, 15 years we've seen Randeer Kapoor, but he's just here to stay and he's just here to tell us that there is so much more to him. That's precisely the feeling that I had. Sounds so much like Depika Padokun, though, right now, dipika describing Ranbiro coffee with Karan, it's like very difficult energy. Did you just compare the show to a coffee with Karan?
1658637370.0-1658639190.0
We are more cheap and frivolous.
1658646990.0-1658666986.0
Actually, my immediate thought would be while the film was going on, so that it's like kind of same what Prince has said. Okay, this is something that I'm seeing after so long. The grander of it and the visuals. I love the visuals. I love the way it was shot.
1658667178.0-1658694890.0
And of course, Ranve it seemed like Ranveer gave his 100% to it. And I loved his father's the way he played his own father. I love the track, I love that flashback. But after the film ends, by the time it ended, I was quite disappointed. So my immediate thought was, wasn't that in adoration of it?
1658694960.0-1658696620.0
I was like, okay.
1658700350.0-1658723858.0
Where do you land on this? Between the picker and. I still land in the middle. Honestly, when I started watching, I was like, okay, so this looked like a theater worthy movie. The theater experienced the whole visuals as I was waiting for the train sequence because Ranbir kept talking about it in every interview and I was watching.
1658723944.0-1658758426.0
So I was really excited for the visuals and I was satisfied with the visuals. Even the first half, I didn't mind, but I found the film a bit loud for no reason at some part, like loud, as in the characters being loud and also the background music being very loud. And I really thought the back to back two Wanikapur songs felt Soda, Yaki. They could have been better songs because we have seen Crazy Karen from Yacht. We have seen those songs in the same zone.
1658758538.0-1658768026.0
I was also reminded of Thugs of IndoStar, which is a bad thing. Massively. Yeah. And like a lot of throwback to Yashra movies. The crown was in doom.
1658768058.0-1658792570.0
To doom. And I was thinking, like, at one point I went with a friend when he was doing the Tories. They finally made Doom for the overall. One thought that my stair in my head was it was quite loud. It also reminded me of a nipath at some point.
1658792640.0-1658804940.0
Mr. Revenge, father Car Revenge and very similar on those lines. But I didn't mind it. But I won't watch it again. That's the year.
1658805950.0-1658824850.0
Correct. When that title card slash for me, for all of us, directed by Karan Malouthra and I felt massively. And I was feeling it was sucker. Like my feeling throughout the second half sort of cemented right at the end. It was that of underwhelming.
1658825270.0-1658849610.0
I was thoroughly underwhelmed. I thought, okay, this is it. This is what I've been waiting for. What felt like a decade and all the interviews, all the this is massively going to deliver and we are going to have a success party and you'll be confident. I kept thinking, no, it doesn't work for me on those levels.
1658850030.0-1658880600.0
I was one of those who really liked the first half. I thought it was long for short, but it had so many moment after moments. Like Shamshira story, then the cliff scene with the father and son, then his escape, then he meets new people. There was so much of sort of event and heroic moments in the first half that even if it was long, I felt like you have me in those moments. Second half, to me didn't feel like any of those enough.
1658881610.0-1658894770.0
I waited for a lot more. So when it got over, I felt underWell. That was my second half. Sorry, go ahead. Second half.
1658894780.0-1658924020.0
What didn't work for me was I couldn't connect to his whole team. Like those characters. Like when that person died, we only had one flashback to play so that we get ready and I couldn't connect to the whole team. And some tropes like Sorab Sukhla speaking and only Rhyming lines that face like a very old trope. I won't mind it if the lines were that interesting, but the lines are okay.
1658924710.0-1658944158.0
I want to add something. What Pulkit said about the Ognipat point. So what didn't really work for me was the storyline. And there were times I felt agnipat undertones, like the sun is avenging the dad's death. Then Sunday.
1658944194.0-1658963470.0
That just gave me a feeling of Kanchatina when he was coming on screen. It was just like the short kaza. So in my head, it was Kanchatina and Manva. So it was even the scenes between Randeed and Sanjay. That Sanjay that is so much like he's done this so much so many times before.
1658963620.0-1658988840.0
And Agnipat had had a very significant impact. It was very similar. So I could clearly draw panels between him playing this Daruga and Kantar China. So I just felt that and then anybody could guess that it's a current Maloratra film because of these undertones. I'm like the storyline could have been better.
1658989850.0-1659022190.0
But I also feel that it's a period action drama. Period action may I think it's a decent pull off. I feel that period action, you can go immensely wrong or people are going to love it. But here I think they've managed that middle ground. They've managed to be in that decent space also, because I love the action sequences also, I feel that they were very nicely shot, keeping in mind that they were shot in a very tough terrain in Ladakh, from what I see, 80%, as you shot in Ladakh.
1659022270.0-1659056974.0
So the action sequences which can somewhere come across as frivolous in such dramas, and Bollywood is capable of doing so, there's a very thin line which I feel they didn't cross. So I think they get some brownie points for the action sequences, even. I think I also felt I felt when I was going into watching Shamshida, I was very nervous because it's such a new thing for so many people involved in the film. I mean, Karan is known for action films, but this scale is something he has also not attempted. I mean, he thinks larger than life.
1659057012.0-1659076226.0
But Virif hadn't still given him that kind of platform for Virif taking runby at Kapoor in such a space. Again, not done before. In fact, wiref, I don't remember they've done such a big film for those examples. But we're a very bad example, actually. I was just going to say that.
1659076328.0-1659103690.0
Yeah, that's a very bad example. Playing a double role for the first time. Father son set in 18 hundreds. All these things were, I mean, on paper, look absolutely something which should not be done or it's going to be very difficult. My thing was we'll be able to pull off like Princess at even a decent film, even though the tailor had, of course, intrigued me.
1659103760.0-1659139110.0
But then all these factors keep reopening in your mind and what I came out being very impressed with the visuals. Honestly, I wasn't expecting I mean, we keep going on and on about how Bollywood does not have good VFX or good action scenes or very choreographed high octane scenes. And here I did see that some of like four to five scenes did stand out. Be the climax, or the one where there are a lot of clothes when the son meets the father, the spirit of the father. I thought that was very beautifully choreographed.
1659139930.0-1659169114.0
And I just felt that all of this I wasn't expecting from a current Malora film because I didn't like brothers, the last one that he had made. So I was quite impressed that okay. There is four, and I have been viewed since morning. I've been also telling friends that in terms of the direction that people keep talking about, will Bollywood take a direction of south, or will south always be dominating over Bollywood in terms of an RR or a case? I see.
1659169252.0-1659175730.0
At least for me, Samshira has shown that it can if it tries harder.
1659178710.0-1659206314.0
What pulls the film down is, of course, the emotions, I think, which could have been more dramatic than what pushed me to loud acting. I felt it was emotionally not intense. My major problem, like, if you look at there should be no spoiler. But of course, a death happens in the film. In fact, two deaths happen very tragic and a lot of suffering and inequality.
1659206362.0-1659209070.0
But somehow I was emotionally distant.
1659212850.0-1659225860.0
Poor guy. I wasn't like, oh, shit. I think some of the moments required me to crush my heart. And I said, take your time.
1659235850.0-1659240300.0
It was so long. But still, the relationship wasn't established at all.
1659242350.0-1659264382.0
Somewhere. I don't know why. I felt that they were also just trying to establish how it feels to have Sanjay dad and Randeer Kapoor together. I just feel those scenes were more focused at, like you said, that the relationship aspects were not really thrown light on. I just felt that they were just focusing on that.
1659264436.0-1659289110.0
I don't know why. Maybe post Sanju or something like that. They were looking forward for them being together. But even the shots where they are together, it's very evident that we are trying to show Randeer Kapoor and Sanju together. I have a question, and to all four of you, because I remember why were Cross so integral to Shamsheera?
1659289710.0-1659295580.0
Did I miss something? Like, I don't think the family in general.
1659305730.0-1659310400.0
I know, Justin, in your mind, you were thinking that they're inspired by Game of Thrones or something.
1659314550.0-1659320180.0
And also like, spoiler, but everything was done by close. In the end.
1659328390.0-1659347158.0
You can take that kind of liberty. You don't need to make sense of every single frame that you've seen. I think that's the thing that's fair. But I really need some view. Let's not say we would commend that auto Justin's sense of logic and non logic.
1659347254.0-1659356090.0
Because then we come to Bulbula a year, too. And then I think we can answer why the crow system will be very satisfied.
1659358930.0-1659373570.0
Maybe it needs some intellectual depth and a lot of force. Intellectual depth. What's your take on the crows? I'm sure you must have them. It all started with the Nagan Parindra in rockstar.
1659377270.0-1659380740.0
That's true. That's a good one.
1659383350.0-1659409440.0
From this. I also remember when Ranbi, the son, goes on to kind of complete the mission of his father. He's also wearing a jeweler, right? And to me, it reminded me of all the films where Ranbir has worn a joola or a bag and he just took on a mission. Especially imagery of Bunny from Bunny til is sling back.
1659416370.0-1659420110.0
This is Bunny in Paris. Camera.
1659424710.0-1659446762.0
I don't know. I think drama could have been just stronger. You are actually making such a strong story, like a revenge story. Then, like, Pulkit and Prakar also said that the relationship between father son, they kind of summed up into one scene where he starts reading about it, right? And suddenly his eyes open and he's a changed man.
1659446896.0-1659468162.0
Yeah, that was bad. And you feel bad also. I don't know if you guys felt that you have a Randy Kapoor who takes in every film two and a half hours to realize that he has come off age, you know, that he can do something. You take that actor and there is like, one scene and you are done. And now he's like, let's move ahead with the story.
1659468296.0-1659474340.0
But actually, like Praka said, the two and a half arts plus, and still you feel no relationship. That.
1659476630.0-1659490338.0
Transition was very abrupt. It had to have some sort of essence in it. But it was missing. Suddenly he was a change man. Yeah, that is something, I agree, that was not easily viable.
1659490434.0-1659509998.0
That train sequence that you were looking forward to, did it live up to your hive? Not really. Like, it was visually good and all, but I think they hived it too much before the release. Otherwise I would have liked it or something. Like they said it's one shot or something and stuff.
1659510164.0-1659518830.0
But that wasn't the most effective scene in the film. Honestly. It felt like a very easy theft.
1659524770.0-1659530680.0
Got done suddenly. Yeah, suddenly he's on the train and suddenly so much has happened.
1659535290.0-1659538470.0
The team has to be together to plan to execute.
1659541290.0-1659552280.0
I think you would also be the right person to solve this query that Justin and I had that wasn't the film very abruptly jumping from because.
1659581850.0-1659583240.0
In the middle of the day.
1659601890.0-1659605150.0
Think, I. Hope there's a disclaimer before this movie.
1659607970.0-1659612430.0
But you had to have some kind of supernatural logic.
1659616870.0-1659620290.0
They were more attached to Randir Kapoor than other characters.
1659627350.0-1659673762.0
Justin, when you actually you mentioned Bipika during the film when this sudden transition happened, like, Randir Kapoor suddenly feeling very like he has to avenge his dad's death and he's full of emotions. It actually took me back to Geraya where Dipika suddenly realized that, oh, her dad was, you know so I just I just thought that these transitions have no essence to it. One scene conflict resolution is so you used to feel that this must be done with when you find it in these films, which are, like, bagged by such reward filmmakers. And then you're like, why? Yeah, because imagine you were like, 25 years.
1659673816.0-1659693450.0
You are breeding this thought in yourself that your father was a traitor. He ran away 25 years. You've been brought up in a way where people are just abusing you and taunting you so much of your inherent, your core, it can't change within, like, seconds.
1659696670.0-1659698810.0
What did you think of onei Kapoor?
1659703890.0-1659710960.0
Apart from the acting, she's very close, like 2022.
1659725670.0-1659738146.0
Even if Varnie was not there, I wouldn't have cared less. Like I know. I think anybody would have pulled up what she pulled up. That's what I feel. I mean, she didn't add anything of her own or anything extra or anything significant to the filmmaker.
1659738338.0-1659763150.0
I also understand that's also, I guess I have to buy. But the delivery thing, the baby delivery thing, that was very random. I'm sorry. But one thing which I can't really discount the makers on is the fact that that baby that she was carrying later on, she was flewing.
1659765650.0-1659773460.0
They never saw the baby. The first scene which they showed is she's actually crushing the baby like this.
1659776550.0-1659784760.0
It's not feeling to the eyes. What were you seeing, Perkins? I said, they never show the face of the baby. Like, it's supposed to be a big deal.
1659789630.0-1659799290.0
Even after the delivery. Like the intensity of that scene and all that. And for doing this shirt, even baby delivery.
1659804610.0-1659826530.0
What were the scenes which sort of worked for you? Like, what were your best scenes of Samsung favorite as the father and son? I think that scene came and blew me when I was watching it. I felt, if this is the tone that the film is going to take, then I'm in for it. Right?
1659826600.0-1659844730.0
Give me some spectacle, give me that drama. And I was hooked. Like, I love that sequencer. And when all the paranadicam is beautiful, what was yours? I absolutely liked the whole father part of it.
1659844800.0-1659856134.0
Flashback. The beginning. I was so much into it. I was so much into the movie, whatever. In fact, I felt like watching Arasa at that point of time because it had some similarities.
1659856182.0-1659875700.0
The British, the villagers, the atrocities. Everything was like that setting kind of both, I think. I like that part of the film was so visually, so stunning. I mean, Agonipath and brothers were not and I don't know how, but this one was, like, almost poetic in any.
1659877750.0-1659884280.0
Song. I mean, it's like my favorite before the release. I've been watching that song. It's amazing.
1659886970.0-1659905982.0
Bianca, for you, even for me, like the father and son scene that you were talking, but also visually. I really like the scene in which. Randeev Singh has Shamshira is hanging on. That and the first tone is thrown at him and then followed by the other stones and then the crows come. All those parindas come visually first.
1659906036.0-1659919006.0
It really hit me hard. I actually said, what a stunning shot. So I like the way it came across visually. So I think that particular shot is my favorite. What about you?
1659919108.0-1659973010.0
I think the whole back story worked really well for me. Like I was in for the movie and I saw the back story here because he couldn't make Sudhi.
1659977530.0-1659982760.0
I thought this is his way of. Sort of giving home a possible.
1659989850.0-1659996940.0
He was enjoying playing the galaxy. He was not lazy in any scene he was doing.
1659999790.0-1660003280.0
I was having a blast whenever he would come on screen.
1660010210.0-1660036070.0
Absolutely having fun. Nearly on paper, it's a nice dialogue, but when you play him to that level, really, I think he also crashed so hard on that line, the fresh vibe only line. It's quite a hard thing where it's coming from, but the way he says. It yeah, sorry, go ahead. Even in the trailer, my favorite dialogue was Queen's Ground.
1660039450.0-1660069970.0
Visually. I mean, whatever you guys have mentioned is definitely work. But I also, of course, love Randy's entry on the horse and when his eyes are shown, because there is a side profile because of that fee, whatever the sign. And then, of course, his face. And I just I remember I also cheered in the theater because I loved that intensity on his face and the whole and how I think even you guys were saying how some of like some of the scenes are so poetically short.
1660070120.0-1660104780.0
I think the whole horse, when he starts riding bali starts riding the horse where it's short, by the way, the Nubra Valley, so beautiful. It's so gorgeous. And I personally really like the one where he comes to rescue Varni. What Varni and Randee are doing with that sarpa where she is actually tied, it's such a fun scene that's like, even these three must have had up. In the air.
1660107170.0-1660134870.0
She'S about to fall and then he gets under the sarfai and I am like, not bad. That seemed only impressed me, but I think I might be minority, but I wasn't that impressed by Sandra because I liked him as an actor. I felt he was doing so much. But unlike Kg where I would say I still found him a little complacent.
1660141710.0-1660154670.0
But it's also like I like how sometimes he would laugh like a child writer. They didn't give him a lot in terms of dialogues.
1660177050.0-1660193302.0
But I get as. Scary as Kandas for sure. I don't think it was meant to be scary. Correct. One thing I wanted to ask you guys also, that what do you think in terms of the storyline?
1660193366.0-1660227910.0
Because for Karan Maloudra, like, other than Randy comeback, what I was looking forward to that he said that it's a fresh story line and this is not a copy or a remake of anything. Unlike his previous options, was a remake of this sin called warriors, which I'd seen, in which the original was a fantabulous thing. I hated brothers because I had watched warriors before. So, what do you guys think in terms of the freshness of the storyline by Karan and Akram? What do you think in terms the storyline?
1660239130.0-1660245050.0
They were not getting the point they were like doing how do we keep moving the plot?
1660247070.0-1660249900.0
Now we will take a sabbatical thing.
1660254110.0-1660256890.0
I like the voice of it like the setting.
1660260450.0-1660262640.0
I have seen it. I've seen it before.
1660268310.0-1660295050.0
What they could have done is that we were discussing after watching the movie that they showed the whole they showed it leniently they showed the flashback first and then we came up to the printer. We could have started with the bridges already saying accusing him of the code and then we get to load business sector. I don't know why I didn't.
1660298430.0-1660312814.0
More impact. I don't mind these victims having very simplistic story. I can take it. I'm not looking for Nolan here. What I can't take is you not.
1660312852.0-1660326100.0
Even sort of respecting that material to. Give it a spin for me. A son dating revenge of his father who was wrong. Great masala life. I think it doesn't mean better than that.
1660330630.0-1660359106.0
So will you say that Karan Maloutra was playing safe because he's so used to remakes? In that sense, I would say Karan Maloutra was not being as inventive right. It's a great line for Masala pill. And I'm not looking for to be blown away by the story when I walk into a Shamshira. What I'm looking for is to blown away by the way you've interpreted a story that I already know interval Kawagh.
1660359158.0-1660368222.0
I know it. I'm not looking to be surprised. But what I'm looking for is to be incomplete off. I knew it. Yet you played it so very well.
1660368276.0-1660375810.0
Mr. Parker gave that suggestion. I agree that you sort of give it a spin to begin it somewhere to hide a few details from even the audience.
1660377910.0-1660386870.0
Make me also feel like Bully at some point of time. Bulhi is the one who doesn't know anything and all of us know, including Karan and the mother.
1660393610.0-1660441874.0
Inventive to make you cry, even if you don't cry, should be choking or you should be geared up either when some surra dies or when Bully is being beaten up. I mean that feeling like I think what Bahubali had done remember everybody I remember when I watched it in a theater, half of the outage was laughing also, right? I mean, just the absurdity of it. But I could also sense that people are also tearing up, right? And that is wabali's craze which kind of like also explains why people still talk about that film.
1660441922.0-1660466350.0
Also something. Absurd, but you're still rooting for it. I think indifferent to what's happening to this character. I think somewhere that in terms of visuals, it was good action, it was good. But I think what they could not get right was to play on emotion.

That you have a terrific actor whose forte is to emote. He's not the action guy. He's maybe more dalums are exchanged or something more will happen and then done. He's like but whatever he says is one dialogue and it reminded me of a look. What did you think about that whole bit where the British aren't really the villains and the Indian police officers, the officers in general are the main people who are being more cruel to them.
1660546270.0-1660548540.0
I don't know. Why did they do that?
1660551550.0-1660586386.0
Make sure the main villain is shoot. The thing and not and it was very predictable, I feel, when the foreigner gathered, the new cop came in, freddie something, the new guy, the way he was speaking and his entire body language, it was very evident that something was going to dominate him. For sure. He'll be an empath and he wishes. It was somewhere predictable for me, when I realized that about this fellow, bulky.
1660586418.0-1660607690.0
Was saying something, the most unintentionally funny scenes was when they were fighting and speaking Hindi. Fighting, fighting, fighting with that British policeman. And he's speaking in Hindi, like, very seriously, but because of his accent, we are like, how to take it seriously?
1660609810.0-1660621220.0
I think they should have kept it in English and with subtitles that would have been like more I don't know, more believable. Because I don't know. I couldn't even make out what he was saying exactly.
1660624230.0-1660671380.0
But that is one thing I definitely feel, which I think people will not really talk about because it's a Marcy film. It's a strong anticast commentary which the film makes almost like it is something which is, I felt would definitely offend a lot of people. I mean, you have a young boy from the tribe clad me on the sibling, if you remember, in the later stage of the film. And you have those scenes, you have those dialogues. And that's why also it's kind of like made very clear why this tribe or these people were still ready to negotiate with the British, but not with the upper car, because uppercast was always against them.
1660672230.0-1660697466.0
And I think, of course, in a very far more, perhaps serious film, this would have been talked a lot about. But I did feel that it was quite brave of current to make that comment. Keep two and two, and not just I mean, even the use of these words, right? Lowercase uppercast is something directors shy away from. And he made no point about it.
1660697488.0-1660726210.0
I mean, if you have to tell a story about the tribe who's trying to get freedom from slavery, you have to say that they were tortured by the uppercast in their area in wherever they were living. And to me, in North India, to me, coming from a virus in a very mainstream marketing film, and this being your conflict point, actually, to me it felt very brave and commendable, actually. Commendable.
1660728470.0-1660735720.0
Not like the ones in the film. It's throughout in the film, they call it and they call them by their car.
1660738890.0-1660744890.0
I think that was very rare. And I can already see people getting offended. The villain of your movie.
1660747870.0-1660754620.0
I can. See already coming in on twitter pages like Hollywood and stuff.
1660758050.0-1660803382.0
I agree with Priyanka here that it's a very brave and a very bold attempt to kind of show these aspects. And what something very interesting is, Priyanka, that in Ladakh caste system is very rampant. I mean, having visiting Ladakh very often, I know that how much of a problem this is and it's quite in the open. So I'm wondering how much of maybe research when they were shooting there has gone into this. Because I have known people who have shared this with me where how even today, like people openly talk about each other's cast and treat them differently that, oh, I'm not going to work with this person because they're from a lower caste.
1660803446.0-1660826398.0
We won't collaborate with this person. So these are problems that are real in Ladakh as of today. It's in the entire country for sure. But what I have witnessed on my own is it is rampant in Ladakh on its own. So I think it would be interesting to know that if in case they have done some research when they were kind of shooting in Ladakh because I think 60% to 70% of the shooting has been done in Ladakh.
1660826414.0-1660837320.0
Yeah, it has happened, I think two months, two to three months shoot happened in Ladakh. I was watching the making. So you feel that Men is gay here?
1660849070.0-1660866000.0
I think so, yeah. And also, do you think Karan Malutra has that unset pressure key? His film is kind of making Randir Kapoor's come back. But when they were making, it.
1660868210.0-1660885062.0
Wouldn'T. Have been that long. Even though I hate to call it a comeback because I don't feel that Randeek had ever gone that he would come back. I feel a longish break. So I just feel that it's a very honest attempt to make this thing larger than life.
1660885196.0-1660905820.0
But as you said, once you approach something with that kind of a mindset that this has to be larger than life, then you tend to have these glitches. I agree. But guys, one by one link, if we ask for your closing line, if you could just tell us that what you feel could have made some era better.
1660907890.0-1660932950.0
We could start with you. I think one is better music for song and the emotional. I couldn't attach myself except the mother. I see at some points with Ranbir. But sometimes I felt like even he's not attached enough with his father.
1660936730.0-1660943030.0
Are you talking about Ranbir character? What is his biographical?
1660946410.0-1660951050.0
That's what he was playing himself. And no kidding.
1660955010.0-1660956800.0
Did the face of work for you.
1660964290.0-1660965200.0
At all?
1660975570.0-1660993660.0
So even I haven't seen ugly first. But I have seen so much of that climax footage and so many people are talking about it. That for the reason I know it's a powerful climax even without you have heard things about that movie. But it's the climax. I don't think I'll remember it for long.
1660994350.0-1661002860.0
If I want to remember. Glimpses where it goes, that cliff scene where both fathers are. Yeah.
1661007810.0-1661023570.0
That'S why the audio is going. So, yeah, I think for me, the memorable part of Rumbi is acting with his father standing and the whole backstory of it. I really wanted the movie to work for me. So I was waiting.
1661029670.0-1661046520.0
And I think everybody who went to theaters today, everyone. Wanted it to work. He's been speaking to people in the industry, like even media persons and everybody's of the same view that we wanted some cheater to work and especially for unveil. So, what about you, Prakur? What did you.
1661049290.0-1661050280.0
Mean? Better.
1661062690.0-1661071620.0
Part of it? More in the team building? For sure. Team building was so necessary in this and they didn't invest it.
1661075670.0-1661087160.0
Because the. Story was so simple. I wish they had played with this linear part of it. They wish that played the screenplay, book back and forth, the visuals of the past.
1661089210.0-1661102140.0
The fact we like it plays with the visuals of the past of his father and him. They could have done that more also, of course.
1661104270.0-1661107710.0
I don't know. I really bothered about the claim.
1661109730.0-1661114320.0
I really wish that logic to it. I can't buy it.
1661122070.0-1661164942.0
I honestly feel that I wish there was more if they'd invested more on the emotional aspects of it, like in terms of the relationship shown, everything was shown very black and white. I feel there are shades of gray when you have all these complications in the relationship and I don't think that they did focus on that. Having said that, I also feel that this film should also come as a welcome change for Ran Beer in the sense of what he has brought to the table. It's new for him, this genre is new for him. And like I said, in the 15 years of he being in the industry, he has tried something new.
1661165076.0-1661196682.0
And for me, seeing him and that of start was not a big disappointment because even I was scared that will he pull this off. Because in the interviews he kept saying that people are not going to accept this easily because they've seen me in a particular way. So I think for this experiment we should be giving a few brownie points to the film and for the sake of Ranbir Kapoor trying something new, one should watch this film. Perfect. I think that's a great one.
1661196736.0-1661210240.0
And here's hoping that Ranbir also kind of expands and does every kind of film because now, at least as an actor, he established that he can pull off such films. And let's hope that we have better such films in this space.
1661212690.0-1661225040.0
If we have something visual, let's also have the emotions that Bollywood is known for and hopefully we'll have and Justin is already very scared for Qatar, but Justin pathan will work.
1661228170.0-1661229160.0
Done now.
1661241450.0-1661251480.0
A. Month later, I don't know, but I am very hopeful for some months and. I think in Grahamaster we can also add mom.
1661261570.0-1661276640.0
We know it's going to be good. But thank you so much for watching it. Of course. The first show and coming here to be with us. I hope that you guys come back if we invite you and you would not say no.
1661282410.0-1661287670.0
All of us love Run Bees, so let's just hoping that Run Beat has hits and hits and hits and better films.

Hello, and welcome to another episode of India Inc on Kirk. My name is Ayanji, and today you'll find me in conversation with Raj Kapoor. Raj is the founder of India Blockchain Alliance, which is an emerging technology think tank in India. Hi Raj, welcome to our platform. So glad you gave me some time for us today.
1657836772.0-1657845026.0
Thank you. My pleasure. Okay, so let's jump on to some questions. Absolutely, go ahead. All yours.
1657845218.0-1657862380.0
Great. So, Jad, let's start with this. What's the first thing that you tell a person who's looking to invest in cryptocurrency when they come forward? First I tell them and I'm telling you the truth. I tell them, 1st, 1st, are you ready to lose your money?
1657862830.0-1657877278.0
A lot of people say, really? Is that the first thing you tell them? I say, yes, those are yours very new investment. However, you can invest, but only invest that much that you wish. And then you say, if I lose this, it really won't harm me.
1657877444.0-1657889966.0
Before you actually get it, become an expert in that. Don't put anything more than that. Now, I've gone way beyond that. So that's not an advice for me, but that's advice for anybody coming in. You only invest what you can afford to lose.
1657889998.0-1657907014.0
That's 1 second thing I tell them, don't follow the leaders. The trip, your space is not one to follow the leaders while you say everybody says bitcoin. Bitcoin. Yeah, it's great to have bitcoin, but look where it's gone from sixty k to twenty k. It's a huge fall.
1657907132.0-1657924046.0
Right? So if somebody was saying, okay, I'm holding at 60K, it's going to go to 100K, because a lot of experts started talking about 100K reaching of them and nothing really happened. You must understand what is crypto. You must understand the dynamics. So really, if it's speaking understand, why are you investing in the first place?
1657924148.0-1657938846.0
There are three projects and yes, fantastic crypto options. However, bitcoin is not the only one. Bitcoin is more of speculation. The others are more of revolution. Look for the ones which are the revolution, not the speculation.
1657938958.0-1657956780.0
All these dodgy coins and she buy and things like that, stay here all the way from there. Those are for real speculators. None of us speculators. Understand a little better, create more, get more aware about what you're investing. That's my second and only piece of advice for everybody.
1657957150.0-1657981130.0
Youngsters, experienced novices, everybody. So all these speculating mean tokens as we know them that you're talking about. I mean, they obviously saw meteoric rise last year, if I'm not wrong. And now they are back to what they were before, even lower. So what are the fundamental things we would suggest somebody research before they choose their token of choice?
1657981210.0-1657990542.0
And what are the metrics should one look at? Yeah, that's a good question. Why? Because that's one of the most important things. Now, I'll give you a simple allegory.
1657990686.0-1658003858.0
When we go into a supermarket, you have to say buying even a shirt for yourself. You'll go, you'll check out the texture, you'll check out how it fits you, et cetera. You will do a little bit of research. Is this a good brand? So on and so forth.
1658003874.0-1658016246.0
You do that even for a simple purchase? Yes, it's a shirt. Whether should I buy a key dog or should I buy it for another cereal, whatever. You do your little research and then you decide to buy that. You don't just go blindly.
1658016278.0-1658035540.0
Somebody says just pick it up and say no, you don't do it gently. Same thing with stocks. There are so many opportunities to understand it better. Now, there are three things which are really very critical. First, does that token or coin serve a purpose?
1658037430.0-1658053046.0
I'm just giving the Commonwealth of people know there are many coins. Do you know that there are more than 19,000 tokens? All can't be serving a purpose. So we need to stick the wheat from the shaft, so to speak. Okay, how do we do that?
1658053228.0-1658066518.0
First, don't follow the trend always unless you're ready to. Okay, you can get in and get out quick and fastest. Okay, you're lucky, you make money. But that's a 50 50 toss up. You want to make money, think long term.
1658066534.0-1658072990.0
That's the first thing. Never think short term. Short term is for speculation. Long term is for investments. Second, look at the white paper.
1658073060.0-1658084050.0
Every coin has a white paper. You can go to any device and look at the white paper. You don't have to read the full white paper. White papers are 40 pages, 50 pages. You don't have to read that.
1658084200.0-1658103474.0
Just read what is it that the coin or the token wants to solve it's? Right in the beginning, the first few pages you'll get that. The rest of it is for investors, rest of it for the other more serious people. That will give you an indication, is it solving the problem? Is this blockchain being used for anything and the tokens being rewarded properly?
1658103522.0-1658113030.0
So on and so forth. Right. There are coins like Shibuyino and Dodds serving purpose, but people made the insane gains. Yes. Do you know how they made gains?
1658113110.0-1658125120.0
That's how we get pool in India or anywhere else in US. For example. Let me pass the question and come back to the answer, and then I'll come back to the question again.
1658127970.0-1658139140.0
White paper understand if it solves the problem or are there projects going on or is it in view of a project or is it a project attached to it? Then you'll get a fair idea. It's just like the same way through white paper.
1658141270.0-1658157846.0
The more awareness you have about how the crypto world operates, and that is the question of shibuyina, dodge, whatever you call them. Right? These are the three things. These are the three parameters we must look for now. How does the crypto system work?
1658158028.0-1658170494.0
That's how Shibu and dodge have made people millionaires also and made people poppers also. We hear about the millionaires, we never hear about the people who have failed. Yes, good stuff is reported. Now, why did why did they make money? I'll tell you why they make money.
1658170612.0-1658183118.0
You have say an Elon Musk talking about Shiva. Suddenly everybody says, all right, that's great. I'm buying shibu that sometimes you can ride the wave and make money. You will not make money. That is the purpose.
1658183214.0-1658211050.0
Now, the algorithms of these coins are built in such a way, make money, except for the core eight or 10% people who exchange these from their wallets and create artificial demand and supply. Common practice of the crypto world. That brings up the prices. People think, all right, they have a lead on, must talk about it and have some other influencer talk about it. Influencers know nothing about the crypto.
1658211870.0-1658213980.0
Talk about it. But people follow them.
1658216430.0-1658226586.0
Followers, followers, I'm going to buy. Right? So, yes, somebody says he's a market mover. Absolutely the market mover. He knows nothing much about crypto.
1658226618.0-1658238066.0
He just whatever he likes, he makes a move. Twitter goes up when he wants to buy. Twitter has gone down when he wants to sell or not buy. It's a dangerous power to have in the market. Yeah, it's a dangerous power to have.
1658238088.0-1658252134.0
It's a very dangerous power. And what happens, we as individuals get swayed by that because we don't have the right research backing us. So we say, okay, if law is a such a rich guy, he's buying it, let's buy it. We will also make money. And you can make money.
1658252172.0-1658280238.0
I'm not saying you always lose money when the wave is going to end. And that becomes too difficult sometimes, because in the crypto space, unlike the stock markets, where there is a gradual up and down, this can be very steep. 60k last year, 60K around this time, this time, 20K. That's a massive decline of a crypto they tried to make. In fact, there was a time in between, I think last year, a year and a half, and everybody wanted to make the sheep one dollars.
1658280324.0-1658305094.0
They wanted to point the price right. It never happened. And that is all the hype, because everybody who had bought it low sold it when it was going up, riding the trend. So beware of influencers who have not too much idea about this. Beware of just following the leaders, so to speak, or Piper of Hamlin Plains, piper and the rest, following it.
1658305212.0-1658321054.0
So a couple of things like that should be clearly avoided, really listen to them. Do your own research. It'll take you just a couple of hours before you make it. In a couple of hours, the price is not going to go insane. There's something wrong with it.
1658321092.0-1658346582.0
Also, if you remember recently there was this squid project that was a huge rug pool or a scam, so to speak. Now, why did it get scammed? Let's understand that a lot of these answers will get very clear. There was on Netflix a very popular series, or The Squid Game or something like that. I never saw it, so I don't know what I know about the scam, but I don't know about the project.
1658346716.0-1658364650.0
However, the project was pretty good on paper. It was written by a bunch of people who are not even from any loan country, like a small Armenia or Pajamas or some places. There were many people in many places. They put up their LinkedIn profiles, put a lot of good stuff on it, which nobody goes and checks. Really.
1658364800.0-1658378078.0
And they never nobody checked. Okay, this is only a three month old profile of no problem. Promoters are only two and three month old profile plus 1. Second, they wrote a white paper, which I told you to study if somebody had read the white paper. There were 42 spelling mistakes in the white paper.
1658378244.0-1658398194.0
Okay, no professional will do that. But nobody goes and reads the white paper. They say, oh, the plot was that you buy a certain number of coins from us, the game, and go up various levels. And at the various levels you get certain cryptos which you can then in cash later on, and so on and so forth. It becomes such a popular thing.
1658398312.0-1658419078.0
From zero to $1,000 it went, and in about three months time, and the rest was all marketing height. There was a lot of marketing built around that. A lot of influencers spoke about it. There was no purpose it was solving. And there was another thing, apart from the spilling mistakes and lack of proper promoters.
1658419094.0-1658444102.0
The third thing was very interesting. The code and the algorithms, and it was mentioned in the white paper, was written like when you want to sell it, you have to find two buyers who would buy it at the same time, okay? Something which you can't predict it, you really want to have it, and it prevents them from getting the second fire. At the end of the day, coding is done by us. I can write.
1658444156.0-1658466166.0
What I like is that if I'm a smart contract writer, I'll do that. I can prevent it from entering any exchange. Long story short, three mistakes nobody read. And the fourth biggest mistake on their website, they mentioned that Netflix is part of a partner to check whether it was genuine or not. And Netflix was contacted.
1658466198.0-1658485198.0
They said no, there's no connection we have with them. People just felt this is a base and like this there are hundreds and thousands of scams going on. I don't want to name them and shame them, but there are plenty of them happening. So just be patient. With good projects, read the paper.
1658485284.0-1658488020.0
It will actually help you save your hard earned money.
1658490950.0-1658504806.0
Musk is a great guy to do some great work from a technology perspective. Don't really listen to him. As far as the coin is a concern, bitcoin is great. Bitcoin went up and he said, oh, I won't accept Bitcoin because it takes up too much energy. Bitcoin went down.
1658504908.0-1658519750.0
That's so fickle and volatile to be unless you're a real speculator. And in that case, it's better. You can bet on the horse and try and win a race out there. It's the same chance. So definitely doing your own research is the number one thing that you're suggesting.
1658519830.0-1658525040.0
Do your own research and read the white paper. And there are a lot of sites which give you information.
1658527730.0-1658543186.0
Asha is asking me, do you think BDC will touch 100K by 24? Will it go up again? I don't think it will touch 100K. He doesn't have the legs to get that. It's a very volatile if some wallets start moving money around, it might just come.
1658543208.0-1658570122.0
But technically, it should not touch. In fact, it has a testing point of $16,400, which hasn't been tested as yet, so be cautious. There was a little uptick recently, and that was because Binance suddenly decided that we will not have any fees on Bitcoin trade, et cetera. All these things make them move up, but I believe that it is not yet really moved up from a danger level. It's right now still remains at a very critical level.
1658570256.0-1658604402.0
I have a question about the long bear market, but I'm going to hold on to that for some time. Let's come back to crypto investment in India. With the current tax obligations there are on crypto, which is 30% right now, plus 1% PBS, do you think it's still a viable investment in India? No, and I'll be very honest, I actually advise many people in the space. Almost 80, 90% of them have moved their investments and come businesses out of India so that they enjoy the technology and the options which they have, but they don't enjoy the tax regime.
1658604466.0-1658620910.0
Now, 30% is okay if you can offset your losses. Sometimes you make losses in business here, you can't offset that loss. That's become the major issue. Second percent. The second thing it does is the 1% TDs on every trade discourages speculation, and therefore money.
1658621060.0-1658652662.0
Liquidity coming into the market becomes limited, thereby what happens? Almost every exchange worth it sold in India has had at least 70%, 60% to 80% at an average loss of turnover, because the liquidity is not liquidity is provided by basically speculators, because they buy in bulk and they sell, of course, with a small margin. So the liquidity is gone from the margin, and the 30% is very prohibitive. I am not saying you don't tax your you should tax what you earn. That's the norm.
1658652716.0-1658669686.0
Yes, but keep it flexible. Keep it just like any other assets. You can offset your losses here. You can't offset so basically, a lot of retail investors feel they'll miss out and some of them have not made money, they made losses. So it's something we just say, I'm still paying anyways.
1658669798.0-1658694114.0
And if you look at it very carefully, it doesn't just tax you for this year, it takes you back then a couple of years and tells you to get paid the tax for those years as well. So not very friendly. A lot of people are moving out of the nation and I believe that I have always cautioned that we have a brain drain 2.0. When I say brain 2.0 I mean a lot of people have moved out of the country. I've seen all startups moving out of the country.
1658694232.0-1658708194.0
Why? We have Ozzy Vex along with his family who are out of the country as well. He's already lost off in Paris. Polygon has moved out of the country. We call ourselves start up India great but I am afraid to say we are not really a startup India we are just a get out of India start up movement.
1658708242.0-1658724414.0
Is it because of the tax structure right now? That is one of the main reasons. That's one of the main reasons. If I move to Asia Dubai, I don't pay tax, I pay next year 9% value added tax. A lot of crypto is based companies are based in Dubai right now.
1658724452.0-1658740802.0
Like a lot of them it's like. This before I used to travel all over India, now I travel more to Dubai, then I travel to my own town. So it's that big change. Yeah, the 30% is prohibited to say. The least and for retail investors 30% is still exorbitantly high.
1658740856.0-1658776602.0
I mean if I'm not wrong in equity mutual fund properties they tax it around 15% or something and as for crypto is double? Yeah, it's double. Basically the idea is the government is not really sure right now as to how to navigate this entire issue as yet. Once I think some guidelines are established and things GST also went through more than 900 iterations before it became where it is now and still it is going through iterations. This is the beginning of the same type of a case because when you're not sure of something new and there is no framework around it, there is no legal or compliance around it, it's going to be dicey.
1658776666.0-1658811878.0
However, let's take a positive and say well they've acknowledged the fact that crypto trading is legal so you can tax it because you cannot tax anything which is illegal or not allowed. But let's take a silver lining and say okay, mouths of trousers there but we have a silver lining, let's take that as a takeaway. 30% tax is not a good idea. I've written many articles and many many of the leading newspapers you'll find my articles in Indian Express Money Control specifically telling why 30% is a really big difference. For starters it just cares of the retail investors or first time investors.
1658812054.0-1658828830.0
They don't do all the research to understand crypto and then the tax just scares them off. It's scary. You can just take it this way. If I'm going to register in Dubai, then I'm not going to pay such taxes. Why would I pay a 30% tax when I don't, when I'm already under pressure as a startup?
1658829890.0-1658841940.0
So it becomes a little prohibited. We need to think, rethink what we've done. Let's see. I'm not going to speculate what we're going to do because I also sit on the crypto advisory panel of the Indian government.
1658844470.0-1658860570.0
Fair enough. I mean that brings me to my next question is about the regulations. There is no stamps and regulations right now and we are still waiting for words from the government. So meanwhile, how do you see this playing out for the crypto investors waiting for regulations and how do they tackle this? Well, the writing is on the wall.
1658860640.0-1658893374.0
We have seen, we are seeing a bear market right now. As long as there is uncertainty, the bear market or what we call the crypto winters will always continue because well before it is all the first flush of speculation. People making money overnight, bitcoin going up every day, 2000, $5,000 suddenly, I mean baseless, but it was going up anyways. Now that time everybody want to make money and well, everybody started off with their accounts and everybody said let's join the gold rush. The gold rush is never going to be there forever.
1658893502.0-1658905926.0
So the sudden moving when the gold rush happens, what happens? Just like in the stock market, people who are having the holdings, they sell it at a higher rate. They are the ones who have the power. They are the big investment. They bought it low.
1658906028.0-1658932266.0
They create the real big perception around oh, this company is going up, that company is going similarly in the crypto. That crypto is going up, this crypto is going up. And then you have the influencer or so called experts who never probably bought a single bitcoin in their lives or have never worked on a blockchain in their lives, talking about this internationally here or whatever. Then you have a lot of media people talking oh, crypto is going to go hit the moon, one hundred K, et cetera. It is tempting.
1658932298.0-1658945254.0
It very tempting for you and I. Why not? Okay. And also everybody gives that crypto has given us best returns over the last 1520 years. It has given us, I'm not denying that but then it was nothing a few years back and suddenly it all came in.
1658945292.0-1658957570.0
Right now it's solved. That statement doesn't hold to it anymore. There are other investments that have given better returns. However, Msncret goes back. You must be selective.
1658957650.0-1658972702.0
Do you buy everything that comes here? A shop? Do you buy everything or you select something? You select based on whatever suits you best at that point of time, going to a party, not going to buy some home. You buy something which is a party gown, party dress, whatever.
1658972836.0-1658982660.0
Same thing in the crypto world. What's the difference? The difference is you don't know. You're just groping in the dark and hoping somebody tell you something hey, you buy this? My friend has bought this and he made money.
1658983510.0-1658986370.0
Go and count that money. 90% of this is bullshit.
1658990630.0-1659002178.0
One guy has got lucky somewhere. Maybe it's possible, but the ratio is one in 100,000. Who actually make money in this space? We will all make money. We all lose money in stocks.
1659002194.0-1659033870.0
Also, that crypto space is a little more it's nascent, it's new, a lot of people don't know about it boils down to education and awareness right now. But it's not. One problem I have personally seen with influencers recommending crypto is that till now, if you're recommending a stock or a mutual fund or something, you need that financial advising license that every firm has. But for crypto and all, you don't need. So that makes it a very dangerous place for first time investors to go on the internet and consume.
1659034450.0-1659045694.0
It will always be like this. Still appliances and frameworks are built around it will always be like that. It was like basically when we started a demonetization. What happened? Everybody is scrambling for their own money everywhere.
1659045822.0-1659060502.0
We didn't know. We don't know what's happening. Somebody said, oh, there's a microchip inside it all sorts of rumors, a lot of panic was created. Same thing in the crypto space. You can create height of panic because you're not qualified.
1659060566.0-1659084254.0
You can say anything. Who's really qualified and who is there to certify you in the first place? Yeah, frankly speaking, I'm also not I will not say I'm certified, but the fact that I'm working in this space in the last twelve years I actually mined my first bitcoin in 2010 not knowing what it was I was doing for fun, so I did it for fun. I didn't do it because I knew the rules and regulations around it. I didn't know what it's legally illegal.
1659084302.0-1659104934.0
I did it in the US. Not here because I need india is not there any way. Bottom line is, as we went now, we are all working towards standards, we're working towards framework, we're working towards compliance. That's a long journey. Nothing has come, nothing in any financial if you look at any financial instrument, takes a little time to evolve and we are not there.
1659104972.0-1659125050.0
We are very much on the ground floor. Let's say this way we have a long way to go out so we. Have to just sit tight and wait for the regulations to kick in and then this all influencers for crypto recommendation thing is going to get in touch. Yeah. First of all, don't listen to influencers right now because they are paid for it and they're not paid in tokens.
1659125130.0-1659139570.0
A lot of times it's not apparent that it's branded content and that is what is dangerous about it. Yes, it is also NFTs is another one. There's no rules and regulations or NFD. Nobody knows what the hell will be a very value tomorrow or not. So be very careful, always there.
1659139640.0-1659167338.0
And as I say, crypto is a very small part of the blockchain. One use case of a blockchain, blockchain is the main thing, one use case. So understand the technology better and if you understand the blockchain technology will always be successful in crypto. I have a question about the blockchain tech I want to hold on. So let's come quickly back to the crypto winter that we were talking about where market is continuing and we don't really have a prediction for when it is going to tick up again.
1659167504.0-1659188654.0
What is your advice for first time investors? And we have just put their money in crypto to ride out this winter. What we should do if you've lost money in crypto, basically, if you have a look at what you're holding, if you're holding is giving again, read the papers. If you are getting no answer where this is going to go, get rid of it. Get rid of it as a loss.
1659188702.0-1659198958.0
It doesn't matter. You can enter into other coins. I always like to say Bitcoin is like the Amitabh Bachchan. Everybody knows Amita Bachchan. Yeah, everybody knows.
1659198974.0-1659216970.0
But Amita Bachchan doesn't give the multi baggers now like 100 to 500 crore movies he doesn't give them. But he's, he's popular, right? But the other ones, look at how the South Indian films came and made thousands of crores worth of business. Yeah, they were long short, they were dark forces, but they were well researched dark forces. Same thing in the crypto space.
1659217040.0-1659235774.0
There are lots of opportunities. I mean, I'm happy to help. If anybody wants advice, I can give that, that's fine. But points have got some certain asset back value or project back value going for those type of points going for the metaverse, for example, is a growing space. Even though right now it's very nascent.
1659235822.0-1659267100.0
There is long term value in that. That's the space where you need to be, where there is actual real world usage going on. Not all NFDS, the NFD space, which entities are built on the blockchains, where NFC are built on go for those go where that is a use case, where it doesn't may or may not have any value. If it's built on the Editorium or any other, those are the ones it's going to go up further because that's where they're being emitted there. So there is a huge happening.
1659268690.0-1659274430.0
There was recently an algorithm. Algorithm has got ten projects on the algorithm blockchain.
1659276930.0-1659288574.0
That's where money should be put. I'm not saying algorithm per se. I'm not recommending anything out. Now the thing is have a look at the market where there are people making their projects. Who's creating projects?
1659288622.0-1659312860.0
On what blockchain are they creating the projects? Is this a blockchain going to be? Is it a cross chain means it's going to be only people can work only on this blockchain, not the others. Look for blockchains which are interoperable, which have multi chain factors. Just like we would do any research, we would do the research line and say they may not give you early and immediate return they will give you.
1659313390.0-1659345240.0
But prompt are also very solid in this space. Still, unless they become a very major occupant in the market, still give you 1015 20% per year. This can give you 50% to 100% as well in six months, one year. I don't know how to keep that. All these buyers, but only these companies, not the companies which people tell us, oh, I'm a big fan of Bitcoin because it brought blockchain into liveline I'm not a big fan of Bitcoin of any asset that has valued basically beyond a little high.
1659346970.0-1659361194.0
That's my advice. So the winters are going to be there for some time to pick up good points. This is a great time to accumulate very good points that are low cost. Some of them are really a throwaway prices. We need to identify them.
1659361232.0-1659378030.0
Yes. Okay, so let's come to NFT for some time now. I mean, it's gradually scaling in India. And I was reading one of the reports that saying that I didn't touch on something last year that there are 1.5 million NFP users in India. It is the 6th in the world.
1659378100.0-1659391758.0
That was quite surprising to me. It's the 6th in the world. So how can a first time investor approach this sector, if I may call it? Yeah, okay. NFTs is a real there are two parts of NFTs.
1659391854.0-1659409250.0
One is the absolute rubbish part of it, which I call them like the board AIDS. And I'm not a fan of Nifty either. Yes, the bodies, the crypto kitties and the crypto punks and all those guys. It sells for millions of dollars. Simple question I ask every Indian or everybody.
1659409340.0-1659421398.0
I'm talking about India, right? I'm not talking about the west, which have money to throw away, and they can do that. Would you buy a crypto punk? And if you do buy it, what are you going to do with it? What are your bragging rights?
1659421414.0-1659441746.0
Okay, I own an original crypto punk. Come on. You can just probably get a few hits on you'll get a few hits on social media for some time, maybe a day, and then after that is nobody's interested if you have a crypto punk or you don't have an original one. Really? Frankly speaking, there are uses of NFPs which are more of real world users, which is where NFPs will ultimately move up.
1659441928.0-1659463474.0
Digital art will always do well, but not the stupid overpriced hype art. In India, for example, we have a highest number of users, number of NFP. But what are they holding exactly? Maybe some ghari coins, something from there. Cricket and SDS are quite big in India.
1659463522.0-1659486306.0
Also. What are you going to do with them first? What happened after the initial plush? What are you going to do with a lot of people don't have an idea. Okay, so NFDS in India will soon have to move toward either sort of a digital model where there is a physical thing attached to it or so what if I can do it with a digital shoe or a digital T shirt or a digital press?
1659486488.0-1659500150.0
I'm nothing much. I personally don't have much value for it. But some people have perceived value. I'm okay with that. However, the Indian market will only increase if there are energy which will give them some value for money.
1659500220.0-1659511802.0
Indians are always looking for value for money. We are looking for sales, we are looking for discounts on Amazon or whatever it is. We're always looking for deals. Indians are deal market. We give them a good deal, they'll go for it.
1659511936.0-1659532400.0
Otherwise they'll zone out equally fast. That's why we've got nothing out of it. I can't exchange it, I can't swap it. Now we are working on many projects where you can actually swap the NFDS in lieu of something and also use the NFDS in the metroverse, so on and so forth. So all those things kick in very easy.
1659533090.0-1659543280.0
Indians are not going to be big. Holders are always going to be europe, South Korea, USA, india is going to be a share.
1659560010.0-1659581822.0
They are also in trouble. I mean, there's a lot of investigation going on. It's all because there is no rules, no regulations, no nothing around it. If for an NFT to buy in India, you don't buy NFTs just based on star value, again, is the NFD going to be of use to you? If it is going to be of some use to you, go ahead and take it.
1659581876.0-1659599862.0
Is the NFD going to be tradable on some other platform? It may be of some use to use. If I buy it from say X-Y-Z platform here and I can't sell it on an open C or even a NFD, what's simple for me, I cannot reset it. There's nothing. I've got some digital code written with me and that's a certain value.
1659599916.0-1659600920.0
That's about all.
1659604570.0-1659615786.0
That's exactly how it is going to be. NFPs in India are only going to be populated. There are going to be some users now. There are going to be in the enterprise world, a lot of people are making use of NFP. Those are NFP will have value.
1659615888.0-1659637934.0
I'm not saying Indians will buy into those dramatically move from what we have as NFP today and a year down the line you would find people saying, what the hell are this? Forget, this is not my cup of tea. The NFPs will have to be start to be traded in the metaverse at some point in time. Then people will say, yes, there is a world. The future currency of the metaverse is going to be NFCs and maybe even crypto.
1659638062.0-1659654838.0
Yes, either they keep it and we don't know whether Indian NFDS will be traded at an international level at this point of time. We are not yet there. At the moment. You cannot really look at NSE as an asset class which we can at. Least look at tip towards.
1659655004.0-1659669078.0
Yeah, I am from this industry, but I would not say that. Look at it. The long term prospects might there will be other opportunities in the future, but let there be another maturity in the market. There's no mature there's immaturity in the market yet. Just buying Lightfold.
1659669174.0-1659687314.0
Don't buy a blindfold is all what I need to say, that's all. And how can a digital creator digital art is a content creator approach. This is a lot of money to be made for them. Money for them is to be made if they have something unique, yes, but sell it on international markets. How many people find digital art on Indian market?
1659687352.0-1659706678.0
Virtually nothing, if you look at the ratio, is nothing. It's mostly going outside. I work very closely with the company called you no matter, they are one of India's largest curator for digital art. So if you want to get into that space, maybe you can contact some good people who are doing some serious work in the digital art space and they promote it outside. Especially for the s.
1659706684.0-1659718954.0
And I outside. They have a relationship with them. Those are the type of ones that you'll look at. If you try and put yourself on an open sea or something, you'll get lost. Like if you just put a product on Amazon, Amazon, there are millions of people like you.
1659718992.0-1659747858.0
What we get, we know who's the people who are actually focusing solely on getting this done and who know exactly where to put, how to put and they've built a community around it where they actually put forward your NFT is as good as your community, your community going to buy. Is it a big enough community? That's all those questions now. First of all, ask yourself, does my mom and dad want to buy the NFT first? If your answer is no, the chances are well, in India, not too many people are going to buy it.
1659747944.0-1659762666.0
If somebody else might buy it, yes, there's a good market outside for digital artists. Very good market. Digital artist is a very big plus point for NFP. However, it's not so mature in India. It all has to be focused outside, so aligned with the right people.
1659762688.0-1659791730.0
There are people in India where you can align with yes, they have a good market and they have for example, there is a girl called Tarini Khanaji, right? She's one of the preferred. She's doing a lot of money. I know one of my students, he's 14 year old, he sells NFC. He earns about five to $8,000 a month, which is not bad for a student studying in class nine better than the salary of most people in India.
1659793030.0-1659812474.0
But you should know exactly my students. So I guided him. Yes, but there are many other people who can guide you and some good sites who will help you. In fact, WazirX now he has a waiting list. If you want to become an approved artist, WazirX and NFT, you have to be approved by them first.
1659812512.0-1659822330.0
That was not there before, now it's there. It's the step point. So there is a lot of popularity. You'll be creating that community and pool of an epic creator. Yes, you need to have a creator pool.
1659822410.0-1659846454.0
You need to have a community which says why I like your style. Suppose I create some fantastic I need to have a community around me which says yes. It's not just only I should say it's the best, I think size where somebody else says as well. And when that happens, that's where the whole death thread becomes viral. And you have to be part of many communities because you have to you have to have many markets the same way.
1659846652.0-1659862598.0
Not just India. It could be India, USA. Cambodia. 20 miles. It's the law of averages, the law of numbers which kick in communities or the larger communities, the better chances of your NFDS or anything, or your focus in the crypto world also selling.
1659862614.0-1659873866.0
It's all about communities. We are all part of our community, aren't we? We are all tribal by nature. We all have opportunities. That's exactly how it coming to the crypto influencer.
1659873898.0-1659895490.0
Again, one of the most common things I see crypto influencer saying that you can look at crypto to diversify your asset class. You have an investment portfolio. Look at crypto and NFDA diversifying your asset class. How reliable do you think it is as far as diversification of asset class goes? Okay, again, if you define NFD as an asset class, you can diversify.
1659895570.0-1659913530.0
Yes, if you define crypto as an asset class, then again, which ones do you need to really do it? That is very important. Diversity comes through knowledge. Again, it's been dying for hundreds of years. Our parents, our grandparents always tell us don't put all your eggs in one basket.
1659915150.0-1659927918.0
We know the risk if it's in one basket. If it's at twelve different baskets, it's safer. But if it's in one basket, the risk is much more. The reward could be much more also on the other side. But the risk is definitely much more.
1659928004.0-1659936866.0
Suppose I have a lack of rupees. Will I put it all in one stock? Chances are no. I'll put it in five, six or maybe ten stocks or whatever. That's the stock market.
1659936968.0-1659976800.0
Nicola Mutual is fine, which is putting in like hundred stocks. Mutual fund is exactly risk mitigation strategy. Same thing whether when you talk about NFDS and cryptos, I think cryptos are a great investment if you know which ones and how really approach them. And I know that for sure because I have seen something, for example a crypto which was worth zero one cents as a listing price. If that becomes 0.1 cent, that is 1000% increase a bitcoin will never move that way.
1659977650.0-1659994398.0
.1 may be if it is a good product, if it's a good project and that is why everything is about this, about being aware. And that's not very difficult. I actually take classes on then making people aware of what to read, how to read white papers. It's just very simple. Make them understand, make them aware and then rest.
1659994424.0-1660007634.0
You are good at yourself. Good. You don't need any advice beyond that. When you do risk, basically you hedge your risks. I would say out of NFDS and crypto buy better crypto.
1660007762.0-1660039890.0
NFDS may or may not have the same value somewhere the NFP today, the current lot in India don't have much value. They're good for yes, if you are an Amita Buchanan fan, you've collected this part of poetry. Now you want to decide the same poetry that's all available on the net anyway. You can decide let's figure out what is the real asset now and then small coins, small projects, but very strong projects are the wrong. That's where we and there are many of them you can diversify make them into buckets.
1660040310.0-1660057830.0
You have a bucket of like blue ship buckets. Then you have the metabolic bucket, then you can have the D five buckets make buckets and then decide where you would like to invest. I have a whole bunch of Excel she's a bucket excel she can share it with you. You can share it with them. That's wonderful.
1660058730.0-1660080958.0
So one of my last questions here is we were just talking about like you were saying that you have actually taught people to have to read the white paper, which is like a whole process. I don't know how to read the white paper. And blockchain as a technology has been a very complicated piece of tech for all of us to understand. So how can we make sense of it without getting too much into the technicalities? Not everybody would have the appetite for.
1660080964.0-1660112250.0
That much you don't have to be technical you just have to do three things just identify three things who are the promoters? Just like you would do for a stock market who are the promoters? Go to the LinkedIn profiles and check from when the LinkedIn profile is active it's available you can just go and even find out 1 second look at the white paper if there are expelling mistakes this is some other waijan type of company or Armenian company which cannot speak English but knows good technology. There are many camps from these areas.
1660114270.0-1660127280.0
If they're asking for money to invest into if they're asking for money to be invested for some reason. Just don't do it. Nobody asked for investment. You have the freedom to buy. After having a look at this is what I'm doing next.
1660127890.0-1660138450.0
In the white paper. Look at what is known as a tokenomics. Tokenomics is not technical. To economics is simple commerce. Where are the tokens distributed?
1660139030.0-1660158600.0
Will automatically come to know if the distribution is too much in the public, there will be too many coins. Also see how many coins they have listed. Okay, what is it like? For example, Bitcoin said, we are only minting 21 million coins and that's it. As a cap 2014, we will not do any more after that.
1660159050.0-1660168630.0
So have a look at these. If there is an unlimited capacity of coins, there will be a constant flow. Then the chances of it doing high is very, very remote. That's what happened with Coin all. There's too much of a supply.
1660168790.0-1660183040.0
The demand is not as much as a supply. Look at the supply. And if your basic economics says that the supply demand is very skewed in favor of supply, the chances of the coin won't go up. These three, four things, if you're going to manage everything else becomes cool. You don't need to know technology.
1660183410.0-1660195650.0
You just need to know yes. Is it being used on something? Okay, suppose Al Gore And is there? We'll go and see how many projects you can go to algorithm. See how many companies are using algorithms as a blockchain.
1660196390.0-1660205538.0
All right, this is what, 250 projects going on polygon. Okay. Got 350 projects going on. There is something happening there. Every one of them will not go spiraling down overnight.
1660205714.0-1660226880.0
Yes, that's the hedge which have got all these fundamentals in place, who have got a proven history in place. Don't just look at this flashy website. That's the easiest way that has a too flashy website. It's easier first like, okay, there's something here is too flashy. If it sounds good to be true, surely is too good to be true.
1660228770.0-1660249814.0
So, I mean, we don't really need to understand the blockchain technology in itself because it is pretty complicated. As a journalist, I still haven't been able to understand all of it. And I've been trying to for social. Technology, you need to understand what the technology is trying to do. Is the application area real or is it something in the air?
1660249852.0-1660260538.0
Wow, something should be there. You have a phone, right? Do you know how the technology works inside? No. But you know how the phone works?
1660260704.0-1660273758.0
Yes. You know what it does for you and there is a real world application of it. What the technology does inside, if you want to know as a technology geek, you will keep and go get into it. But if you don't want to, I don't want to get into it. I don't know.
1660273764.0-1660284958.0
I should take up the one pressure button as you speak. Same thing in the space. Who's the promoter? Okay, apple. Will you buy an Apple or you'll buy suppose there's an old new orange phone series coming up.
1660285044.0-1660305014.0
You don't know the orange is will you buy an orange? You buy an apple? You'll buy an Apple because, you know, it's been there. It's got a tracker record, it's got the right founders, it's got right RND, et cetera. Same thing in this space, there's less of research work to do, but at least, you'll know, okay, if I go to an algorithm or an avalanche site avalanche, what are the projects going on?
1660305052.0-1660331450.0
Everything is mentioned there and it's all open because of the blockchain. So everything is transparent. If somebody got 300 projects going on 300 projects going on and they mentioned all the projects and you can check the projects and the rate and the coin and how much they are on the exchange, that's what you must do. Understand us, the basics, the fundamentals does this coin which I'm going to buy, what is it doing? Oh, there are 300 companies working on that blockchain.
1660331530.0-1660342580.0
Makes some sense. I'd rather buy something which is about one company working or two of them trying this done, 300 company. I'd rather go for that right now. It's better to be safe than sorry.
1660344710.0-1660371114.0
Technology you don't need. You need to have basic common sense. We're almost at the end of our time and I'll come down to my last question is what kind of a risk appetite should one investor have? Like a first time investor have while entering this space, you have told us a lot about what to look out for, what metrics to look at, fundamentals to judge what sort of risk appetite should I be having when I enter. I think I answered it at the beginning put in as much as you can afford to lose.
1660371242.0-1660396374.0
So your risk appetite should be if I am putting, say one lakh rupee, I should not cry and say one latup, please. It become zero happened in the case of Luna recently, it was $118. At some point it suddenly began zero also. Okay? So bottom line is you just allocate that much money to what you can afford to lose and not really stay awake at night.
1660396412.0-1660424470.0
For you are anything with any investment is a risk and the risk means it carries that risk with it you should be ready to gain also and lose also. That's how it is. You just have that is the only advice I have to invest for that much and don't borrow money and put it into the stock markets. Don't borrow and don't blame the world for it. If you have made a decision, stand by it.
1660424480.0-1660433626.0
Even if you lost your money, it's your decision. You lost your money. Doesn't make a difference when you lose, you can also gain. You can become a better investor after. That stands right for all sort of investment.
1660433658.0-1660445794.0
Do not borrow money and put into. Investment absolutely today, when you buy a share of reliance, you're not buying today as alliances face value, correct. You're buying it at the future. What is that? The alliance will be making the potential same thing.
1660445832.0-1660456120.0
The same thing with critical? Not much different. It's just that the name is wrapped up around some secrecy and the software. And all sorts of people wearing hoodies and all that we're not very goodies aware of. Not only.
1660457770.0-1660465900.0
I mean. Ashley, do have a question? Any points I need to do some research on that has potential, but I don't. Think we will be doing any crypto recommendations here.
1660468750.0-1660476270.0
Kept on saying that the research that we need to do. I'll be happy to guide you on how to look for the recommendations.
1660478290.0-1660488762.0
That really brings me to the end. Of my questions. Thank you so much, Russ, for making time for us today. It was a really informative session and I hope to see you back on our platform soon. Anytime.
1660488826.0-1660498498.0
I'd be happy to do then another six. Months time. How you can make money out of NFDS properly. I'll have it. You have to come back from the conversation about NFC.
1660498594.0-1660507158.0
All right. You take care, all of you. And anybody wants to connect with me not a problem offline. I can help you try and make better decisions. That's all.
1660507324.0-1660513970.0
I cannot guarantee anything, but I can help you make better decisions. Okay. Thank you so much. Right. Cheers.

Hi Mahesh. Welcome to Colkey. This is our new social media platform where we facilitate conversations and it's lovely to have you over, especially in the face of Mali and Conor's success. What a lovely thank you. So let me start with the latest term, of course, how you became part of it and what it's would like to work as a writer and a cinematographer on the project.
1659226970.0-1659280374.0
So primarily this is directed by one of my associates only so has been working with me for the past all my and also he's also a senior most a friend and working in for a long time. So when after see you soon, there was a commitment that I should do something for me and Far, both of them wanted Sajid to direct the next Philip which has come the production of Our Father. Then this idea came up and so this was during the first stage of the second stage of COVID so restrictions were still there. We were supposed to shoot only with a limited group. So that point, since I am myself writing the film so he just need to collaborate some way or the other.
1659280412.0-1659333670.0
So I thought of like earlier Sanu, my usual DOP was supposed to shoot the film but his dates were not available since he was shooting at Telugu film called Samsung arrived. So in that manner it turned out to be an accidental flame or on the field and I shot the film like that. Okay, a happy coincidence. But what lovely. Especially the scenes of father being trapped in the landslide it really was affecting the dark, but affecting like I said when it comes to films and considering that you are excel at writing, directing, editing and cinematography, on what basis do you choose to be a part of something?
1659333740.0-1659345290.0
Like for example, why did you choose to direct, say, a takeoff versus only write Malayn? Can you how do you make that decision?
1659348610.0-1659406078.0
Primarily, I enjoy all the process first of all, so I started this thing with say for example, I started other than editing, I started with a film called Milli which was directed by Rajesh Milli, who is no more right now so he's the person who directed Traffic and also I enjoy writing. So from editing I shift to writing and then from there I shifted to directing and also in that sense I'm still learning. So in that manner, whether I do the film or direct the film or I did a film or I'm writing a film doesn't matter for me. Somewhere we are constantly working, so that's the only role and it's not that every film which I collaborate, even if I collaborate as a producer, it may not be like I should write or direct him out. It's all a collaborative process.
1659406164.0-1659457838.0
So in that manner, this film, from the idea itself, we all wanted to direct this film, we just want to see him as independent as any other director. So in that manner, it was written specifically for him. And then only while the execution part was decided, because of all the other restrictions and all other problems, I happen to shoot the film that's only been and mostly it's the kind of what do you say, Likability? What each of us have, like, say, for example, Farad coming into a project or Sagi directing a project or somebody else joining with us. It's as simple as how, like, many people work together, come join their hands and then work something out of it.
1659457924.0-1659483974.0
It's not that still it's all a precious project. So it doesn't mean that I should direct or I should write, nothing like that. This is made like that. Okay? So one of my questions that I have especially considered Malayalam industrial case, you have this interesting talent where you can direct, you have the freedom to act and you have the freedom to write.
1659484092.0-1659512622.0
There is no boundaries set for anybody as long as somebody excels, that if they are appreciated for it. And that is a space that is not there in many other industries. Probably a director writer or actor director. But my question is, does Malayalam film industry take an active does it actively foster such talents? How has it been for you when you said, okay, I'm moving from editing to writing?
1659512686.0-1659545206.0
What was the expectation like from artists or the producers? See, primarily the main thing with Malan cinema right now is having a good sign is there are no studio producers here. So only there are independent producers. Studio system doesn't function over here. So in that manner, see green lighting a project and getting somebody getting a project mount a film, difficult as any other industry.
1659545238.0-1659576962.0
But the problem is this life between only a few of our people. It comes with only six of five or six people have to decide and then let's decide, okay, how we want to approach this film and how we want to mount this. It's all independent decision. So there is no waiting period, there is no focus group, there is no lots of creative producers adding, coming and giving dead and all these things. This is not the always didn't have all such things.
1659577016.0-1659614190.0
Even when did all these studio systems came into Bollywood or some other industry. Also, it is also because of the earlier also there were only different producers making a film. It's like convincing two or three people and making something out of it. So there is always a potential where investors or producers who just focus only on the kind of content they are creating and the money, how much they put, how much the recovery they are going to make it from there. And industry being small, everybody will understand how much revenue it can be generated.
1659614270.0-1659638018.0
Only thing is that and then it's all mutual trust. If one film doesn't work, then we'll try with another one. So it's again a commitment, like an actor, if he's committed to a producer or a director and that film doesn't work. So then probably you'll be giving an assurance to the same producer saying that okay, I'll come up with that. Let's come up with some other ideas.
1659638114.0-1659665842.0
You can pick up some money from whatever you have lost from this particular place. This is mutual always. But that is a kind of coworking space with existing Manila, I think mostly because it's a smaller industry and of course, it's all known faces, known people. And even if newcomers are coming, they are all open here. It's not like Maryland's industry is against music.
1659665896.0-1659708830.0
No, because if you look at the films, like out of say 130 or 140 films made up, made per year, it's almost like 60% to 65% of the films are made by newcomers. So in this industry, so in that manner, everybody has got equal value, equal rights and equal freedom of expression that they can have their comment on a film and then make their content. And then the only thing is that this is the kind of freedom which we need to which makes us some more liberal in terms of the content which we are creating. Otherwise there will be restrictions. So that is the real hope which certainly which we belong in this.
1659708900.0-1659725094.0
There is no other kind of machala norms or anything like that. Yeah, at least what we say is that said and done, whatever said and done, like the film should run with a minimum guarantee thing. So that at least whatever money is put on a film has to be recovered. That's it. Right?
1659725212.0-1659762690.0
So that brings me to the next question. It's interesting that you brought up individual producers. The thing about Maryland industry is after especially during the Pandemic, the world discovered this little industry in India and they've been appreciating so many films, old and new, that's coming out of the industry. Do you think that such because the industry is so free or maybe doesn't have set boundaries that it fosters that kind of view even within the content? Is it one influencing another or how is it like active participation?
1659765670.0-1659785270.0
See, I didn't understand the question properly because is it in terms of distribution chain you're talking about or in terms of production you're talking about? I'm talking about it green lighting projects. Like in terms of green lighting projects, has the attention, the new attention? Has it changed the way that produces green light projects?
1659787690.0-1659800058.0
See, it has never changed. It is still the same. Still remains the same. Only thing is that every industry, you're always as good as the last film. That is your credibility.
1659800154.0-1659831350.0
Like every filmmaker, director, writer, editor, editor, doesn't matter because films come and go. But main crew, whoever is the creator of the film, that will be the writer and the director. So writer, director, if it's a combo, then it's an added challenge. And then so there also the thing is like, if your last film is good, you are successful, then you know you can push your boundaries a little more and then put something else. If your last film fails in the box office, then you'll have to be cautious how to get something out of your next thing.
1659831420.0-1659870740.0
But all are supportive. Only thing is that we see the way the industry functions as a change. I think from the all, this is the same system which we follow because as you said, the only thing is that whether the team like the film or the actor like the film, whether you want to go ahead with the film, yeah, you're going to go ahead with the that's it. So it's only very easy for us to think about a project and then talk to each other.
1659873030.0-1659903514.0
It's transparent and that's the kind of freedom which we get. Sometimes a film will get shelved even at the last minute. That also has happened. It's not that it's very easy, that happens in every industry, but the problem is that is because of some other reason, maybe because of the conviction of a person is lost in the last minute, or sometimes the fund is not properly released at the last minute, or some other issue happens. So again, this again happens in every industry.
1659903562.0-1659936090.0
But here the thing. My only worries problem is since we are bombarded with all sorts of content in various platforms and other medium, every six months, content gets expired. The life of a content, the expiry date of the content. For me it's six months because somewhere the other similar idea or similar thought or similar film will come up in any of these languages and people will find similarity. Okay, this film is something like this.
1659936160.0-1659941050.0
This film is not unique because it has got some other lines instead on some other lines.
1659943070.0-1659985270.0
So what is the point in sitting on a subject for so and so many months and then green lighting at a stage where it becomes like so by the time it gets green lighted, it moves into a space where now they all sit on going with the production. And that will take another, say for example, eight months. So ultimately, from that idea to realizing that project onto the screen, it takes almost like three years. So by the time the salem comes, it's as old as three years old. So our thing is that if the idea is fresh, if it's good, and if the actor is it's not about one actor.
1659986010.0-1660007680.0
We have multiple choices, right? We have different, different actors. So if somebody is not free, we can easily approach a different person and if that person has agreed to the script, then we move on to do the production. So my thing is that unless it's a massive scale production or some other things happen, chaos these days, it's coveted. We don't know.
1660008290.0-1660035446.0
Anything can happen any day. So also some accidents can happen or some other hurdles can happen. So that is different. But ultimately an idea, if everybody comes on the same page, then let's more make the film. That's the kind of conviction what this industry has always and that's the reason why this industry has got some kind of credibility also with different people, right?
1660035548.0-1660053360.0
So in that case so let's stick your creative side. For example, like when you write a project, do you see yourself directing the project or do you kind of not think as a director when you're writing and you take it in steps, what is your process like?
1660058530.0-1660085494.0
Idea comes first. So idea I pick up all my ideas from surroundings. So whenever an idea comes to me, then I sleep over it for a few days and if the idea still remains in my heart and then if it's asking too many questions to me, then I will feel that okay, there is something in that. Otherwise if it's not happening or not working, we'll know that after a few days we'll lose the excitement. So that's the excitement level which you have to hold.
1660085532.0-1660113810.0
Cinema like film writing is not for me, it's not an organic process for me it's more dependent to craft. It's not like story writing or a novel writing where you don't know the culmination part. You might not have an idea where the characters are flowing. It's all organic now we sit and think about it and then graduate, graduate progresses, but here it's different. We need to know about all the this is my way of writing.
1660114470.0-1660147046.0
Every person has different different perspectives. So my thing is always consider this as a craft form where we need to know what is going to happen next and how special or unique we can narrate to this to audience. And then what is the USP in the film? Is there anything like if somebody else has made something on similar lines and why that has been made and how much commercial possibilities are there? Because I'm always trying to explore the midstream which midstream means it's neither the commercial or the art school cinema.
1660147078.0-1660182950.0
So there is a midstream clearly depicted in Maladam cinema, which used to be the most golden period, where films are critically acclaimed and commercially also like in terms of values, at least commercial match in some way or the other. So I believe in that stream. So there if that idea fulfills, it's not about pickmarking all the exceptions, norms and everything it's only about how much pressure that film is about, how much pressure that thought is about and how far I can go to realize that project and whether that would remain as film.
1660185950.0-1660225942.0
And also it has to reflect to other people also it's as simple as when I'm narrating this thing to other person, let it be an actor or a technician, whatever, what is the reflection, what I'm getting from them? It definitely matters to my screenplay. So there only that's the route which I always pick. And then by the time when you realize that, okay, this is the next film and I do focus on one point that I do only 1 CM time. So multiple focusing is not possible because 1 CM time brings one angle that, okay, you are sitting on this film for a longer time paid and you're giving everything onto that and let's make it better.
1660225996.0-1660260190.0
And then from that, whether it's released or not released, that is a different because nowadays it's a problem of getting a proper release date and everything. But once the film is done, then we'll have a space to move on and then try and think about other things. Unless and until we could just move, there is a time period where we also creatively feel that, okay, this is the time to move on. So unless and until that is not done, we can move out of a project in the sense of what a particular story, screenplay or a film and then move on to next. Sometimes a film stays with us for a long time.
1660260340.0-1660285894.0
Sometimes even after working for one year or one and a half year or two years, the film will never get realized. So there are hurdles, there are different, different problems. See, that doesn't mean that your confidence is gone and you are not worth. That doesn't mean like, that. Every idea has got some kind of a potential where, you know, say, for example, Malik has been taught and analyzed.
1660285942.0-1660331154.0
And I wanted to make Malik as my first film, which I started from 2011, and finally I could shoot Malik in 2016. So it took five years for that film. But I didn't shoot the very first screenplay which I wrote in 2011 because that was that is outdated for me. So by the time when I move into the next, like, you know, next next stage, I will have to redefine that thing and then, you know, refine the screenplay process and then the visual narrative process has to be refined and everything has to be everybody has to come onto a single page so that everybody understands it well. And my process always has got this kind of a meter where I spend a lot of time in pre production.
1660331202.0-1660361934.0
So my production is very easy. Making of the film is very easy. Then that gives extra some more time for the post production part and then finally the lease. So my whole the toughest part of my production is the pre production part, which adds the writing also. Okay, so when you decide, like, for example, with Malin Kuno, you said that the cinematography part was a coincidence, that it was at the end.
1660362052.0-1660386782.0
But when you move, do you visualize who the technicians would be or is it more free flowing? Do you have like, okay, it's fine, whoever it is and is the technical crew not set in stone. When you write, basically. See, once a first draft is done, we start pushing it. It's not the first draft we are going to shoot.
1660386946.0-1660399414.0
I often go to floor with my four fifth or 6th. Sometimes it's the 9th or the 12th draft. So we don't know. So every time, whenever I'm narrating something, we get feedback. I take feedback.
1660399462.0-1660428898.0
Feedback in the sense it's not about whether it's not about random feedback. It's about how a particular person feel about it. And with that aspect, we keep on working so that collaboration happens. And after the working stage, I mean, after the pre production, when everything is done and when the final draft is ready, then we go to the shoot. So shooting also what has happened is that that makes because it is as difficult when you say every film can be shot in chronology.
1660428994.0-1660457470.0
So sometimes, if you take a for example, take off, the climax was shot in the beginning because I had date issues with most of the people. So in terms of Malik, if you look at Malik, it was short reverse. Because age wise actors has to be like, you know, they have to gain weight. Somebody has to gain weight and then reduce it. So it's not very difficult for me to put that because in the production budget will not under our litigation.
1660459170.0-1660483478.0
Probably what we all think is, okay, whatever the convenience, what we have, we should get on the same page as early as possible once the final draft is done. And then we go on to the ship. And finally, in the editing table, what has happened is that is the real final draft where I write. I mean, the editing is also kind of the final writing. How much is required, how long?
1660483644.0-1660510240.0
But that's the stage where we decide. So if we have clarity on the pre production and the first draft, I mean, the final shooting draft, we have that maximum clarity on it. Then the execution is very simple. And after that, then my editing process also becomes very simple. So I believe in this writing portion so much that then the argument, the takeaway, how much you want to show, how much is the back.
1660511110.0-1660542460.0
Because every scene take for example, it starts with a scene who was born, she's taken from a hospital by his parents into the house. That becomes the core part of the thing in the first few minutes of the film. So we don't know. We have never established what is the backstory of this family, how she was pregnant, whether do we have pregnant agencies where the mother was used to help her and what was Annie's problem with them. We don't know.
1660543230.0-1660563934.0
It's not that when you start a film, these characters have lived for a longer time period. You have to realize that also that backstory has to be written in a sense. It's not as a detailed writing but at least we should have a clarity from where does these characters come from? What is their background? How did they get married?
1660563982.0-1660579782.0
So all these things has to be clearly explained to the actors. Because whatever questions what they're asking am answerable, I need to answer all these questions. It's not that one fine morning I will tell them that okay, like this and no, I don't know anything about that. You make up your own story. That doesn't work.
1660579836.0-1660601330.0
That doesn't work always. So it is my responsibility to share all these things to my declarations and access. But they are also clear with this thing. Okay, so how was collaborating with other creators, like for you? Like when you have an idea of all of these different facets of the meeting?
1660601510.0-1660612880.0
What is it like for you to collaborate with another director or with another film photographer and an editor? What is your equation with them? Like having worked in that particular space yourself?
1660622860.0-1660637904.0
Let me explain one thing. Every writer can't collaborate with all directors. Neither. Every editor cannot collaborate with all directors because it's a different process altogether. So only there is there should be a kind of a common ground which we will also feel, okay, something is happening like this.
1660637942.0-1660652484.0
So we have a similarity in this. Why are we picking? Because it's not about like since that particular technician is an expert in that zone, I should go and work with that person. That doesn't mean it doesn't work like that. It always works.
1660652522.0-1660669656.0
That how the sensor, the sensibility is matched. Whether my sensibility and the particular person's sensibility match. And even if I'm going to edit for somebody else, some other director, I will also look at his way of sensibility. Ultimately, cinema is a director's, craft director's, media. So you have to follow the director.
1660669688.0-1660717268.0
Whoever is the director, you have to follow him because his vision is going to be on screen. So as a technician, our task is to basically compliment all these people and then make their life as easy as possible and also give the kind of honest opinion and be transparent as much as possible and fulfill his vision, his or her vision. So the vision might vary. Sometimes the vision might vary so that we will understand in the first stages of discussion. That's why I always ask, like some of my directors, sometimes they come up with a script where they are writers also that I will let them in which formula or the other they want to read it to me, or whenever I want to read the script.
1660717284.0-1660742180.0
That depends on me. But sometimes if a director comes with a different writer and also that at that point I'm editing it, I often ask the director to narrate the film, just simply to know what is his vision. Generally, I will know whether I am working to work, because it's a longer journey. It's like three months, four months journey. So that journey there will be conflicts, there will be issues, there will be other problems.
1660742330.0-1660766430.0
So ultimately we are all aiming to make the film perfect. It's not about fighting for egos or independent egos. It's all about the film. So that means there should be a moment where everybody should be on the same page and discuss about it and then move on. That makes the life easier for all of us.
1660768000.0-1660787660.0
Okay? So in that case, what happens when you like for example when we think about taking firms outside of India and so far big budget films have had it easier. They have been able to be distributed outside India. But how does distributing Malayalam firm outside work? Do you depend on film festivals?
1660787820.0-1660814744.0
Because Adeepa has recently won a brilliant, brilliant film festival. So that is where my question comes from. From your perspective, is distributing indirectly, does that work in terms of Malayalam budget or would you depend rather on going the sun festival route? How do you see Malala film industry spread outside of India? That again depends on the kinds of films which are which are going to make.
1660814782.0-1660853376.0
So we first of all we need to understand who are the set of audience like, you know, who are the final viewers of the films. Certain films will have seat take for example, all the films would have done so far except that a I have only tried a theatrical aspect or a distribution aspect in terms of Indian audience. Indian audience in the sense it's global fees. There are overseas takers take off also released simultaneously abroad. Even Malik also released in platform and it had a worldwide release and even Fusion had a worldwide release and also Malayan Gunna also had a worldwide release.
1660853408.0-1660898964.0
So it depends also but like coming to see as a second Preston which is meant for festival distribution then that's a different angle. That means that film is something which is very special where we are set to a different set of people and we are trying to showcase that film in an international festival and come back later in India. So that first we are showcasing there and we'll try because there is a kind of thing which is always termed as exclusivity in cinema. Because if you've already released that film in India or overseas then that exclusivity is gone. So there is the premiere possibility of some kind.
1660899002.0-1660925320.0
So what I'm having with AREEP is basically I'm having a premier which is a virtual premiere of that film in Lokarno and then I'm having an Asian premier and some other festival. I might have a North American premier and some other festival. So in that manner I'm trying to figure out like what is that particularly? So that again depends on the kind of film what I have. It doesn't mean that can go into that route and explore path.
1660925480.0-1660958810.0
That's also a different route. Only thing is I'm trying something with Araipa which is because the kind of making and the kind of output what the filmmakers come up with and the intention was also to make something without adulting too much of commercial masala content and all. So that he knows how much of this can be catered towards separate set of audience in the festival circle. And so let it be niche. Let it be very alight or very privileged kind of people that doesn't mind but let it reach and then come back.
1660961020.0-1660975160.0
But for that what we need is we need patience. It's not that one fine warning. You will get a film in lockarno and then we can travel. So you'll have to give a time. Say for example six to eight months of a time has to be given for a film.
1660975240.0-1660989276.0
So that it has to run. It has to run in different vessels and then get our feedback. Then we will get international sales, then we will go on. So that's a different altogether, a different route rather than theatrical business. So we have tried all sorts of businesses.
1660989388.0-1661008360.0
Malaysian cinema has got takers everywhere nowadays. It's not about the language and the sensibilities are all blurring nowadays. So my point is recovering great money in BCC because Middle East has got a great amount of Kellabi population.
1661011660.0-1661032796.0
It's a film runs in Kerala, it definitely will run in Middle East also. The bias there also will be happening. So it's the same scenario for all Indian films. All Indian films who are living abroad is also equal to the Indian population which is living inside the country. So that's it has to be distributed simultaneously.
1661032828.0-1661076492.0
Because that then the revenue can be generated permanently. Because otherwise once the film is released over here earlier they used to do that film in India. If it has got a good opinion then somebody from some buyers from the Middle East or Europe or America will come up and then take the film and then distribute it after one month or not that era is gone now. Because now direct distribution and also parallel distribution gains a lot of value also for the film. Because they are also this exclusivity matter which is being viewed at the same time in Kerala or Hyderabad or Bombay or the same film which is viewed in Middle East or America or North America, Australia at the same time.
1661076546.0-1661087250.0
So that means the audience also are feeling that okay, they are not getting cheated. They're also getting that I'm also watching the film on the same day.
1661089960.0-1661113364.0
Okay, interesting. Because what happens with distribution is budget also plays a big role. And as you said, competitively. Malayalam film industry is a small industry. So when it comes to big budget films it's always easier to market them outside of the country other than say a Middle East where we have like a big population of people who enjoy Mallyala films.
1661113492.0-1661142720.0
So my question then is like for example. Say abhi if you compare a bug or a victim, for example, these are films that have first day collections that are really huge even outside of India. Yeah. Do you as a part of some Malayalam film industry perspective, par Mohanlal and Mamudi is filmed. Do you see this kind of collection, this kind of reaction for other films?
1661142880.0-1661162456.0
Because centered only on content steve, I. Can state my example only like my first film Take Off in 2017 it collected more than ten crore in GCC alone. The film was made with a budget of 6.5 crore. But the film was sold in Mg. Sold to Mg for a distributor there.
1661162558.0-1661189324.0
So that doesn't mean that the distributor should give an overflow to my producer. But since it was given as an Mg but the strategy was very transferred saying that because it has got relativity and we are not making Masala I'm not making Masala kind of a film. I'm not saying that that's wrong. For an industry to survive, every kind of film has to exist. Like a plate should be filled with all kinds of curries.
1661189452.0-1661212600.0
So in that manner so everybody should have an appetite. People have different different appetites. So the majority appetite will be different from the sensible thing of appetite. So also, the midstream has also got a different set of audience. So, my point of view is that how much of the money which is spent on a film, the copy of the film and the recovery has to have a balance.
1661213260.0-1661236770.0
If that balance is not there, then there is no point in distributing something like that. If that balance is achieved, then this way or the other way is say for example, Vikram, they have generated more than 100 crore outside of the country. So that means a huge success. It's a huge success. It is not that every film will get a success like that.
1661237300.0-1661271964.0
Once in a while, film gets that kind of reach in a different territory. But also in this scenario, my point of view is that the consumption of midstream cinema the people who consume midstream cinema are largely sitting largely used to postcode this is the postcode scenario are largely used to this platform viewing. Because I will tell you an example of a theater in Kerala. Trivandrum. Of course.
1661272002.0-1661288972.0
Trivandrum. There's a theater called Calab One which is actually because earlier days, how it used to be is that only films won't release in all theaters. Right? One film will be dedicated to a specific theater. This particular theater is a second station.
1661289116.0-1661312756.0
This is not a releasing station which will get a second station. But what happens is that there are a huge set of crowd, middle class, proper, film loving crowd who wants to watch this film only in this specific theater alone. Because they don't want this shore beat and all. They don't want all these noises and all. They want to watch it peacefully without any trouble.
1661312788.0-1661348736.0
And then they will watch it and they will leave. So there is a minimum guarantee collection for that theater itself. So now, my point is after the COVID scenario, post COVID, the thing is people have invested a lot in subscriptions and people are all some of them have equipped their houses with good flat screen TV, some of them with good home theater systems. So their problem is why should I go out and watch this film in a theater? So we have to give them an invitation that there is a unique experience for this particular film in theater.
1661348848.0-1661370676.0
Please come to theater and watch and have this experience. So I am pretty sure that these days only films with experience are worked in theaters at least for the next two years, right? At least for the next two years. Because what is it? It's not about see, in terms of experience, what I'm trying to tell you is that it's not about Bahu Bailey or KGF.
1661370788.0-1661416616.0
Exactly. It's not bad. It's not something like you have dedicated your money, your space, your time and everything for that particular three hour of film and you're going there to watch that film. So for that kind of an investment, a filmmaker is liable to give that kind of an experience to them. So understand, that is not there, then that promise never gets fulfilled.
1661416728.0-1661462772.0
That is my reason. So, going forward, should we actually concentrate on exponential films for theater? Do you think that will lead to more successful box office firms paid for any industry? See success when you make a film honestly and when you see, for example, there are different I will tell you in terms of advertisement, earlier they used to spend a lot in advertisements. Nowadays that spending in advertisement is turned less in terms of big brands also because they now realize that it's all about YouTube and influencers who are promoting the brands.
1661462836.0-1661499700.0
So now, what is the purpose of spending so much on a particular advertisement other than just giving some money to a particular influencer and then ask them to promote it as per their norms and their views and then tell it honestly. So that's the same scenario in cinema also, see, we have got fiction as cinema. In the fiction viewing, we have got multiple channels. So my only problem is when a platform, when a platform like Netflix or Amazon or any other platform says that we are not going to take direct digital films anymore, that is the scenario which is going wrong. Always.
1661499850.0-1661522072.0
See, only thing is that at least I feel the Coexistence. Where is the Coexistence? Coexistence is some thing where a filmmaker has got a freedom to write a film for theatrical and for digital. Because digital itself is a new revenue, right? New revenue.
1661522216.0-1661543568.0
I'm not talking about shows, I'm talking about original films. So if that window is closed, ultimately what is happening here is that the midstream window the films with good content window is coming into theater. So now we need to add some extra flavoring to that. So people should come back to theaters and watch this thing. Otherwise they will also think that what should I come?
1661543574.0-1661579992.0
Because anyway there is a model which is anyway, this film, this particular film is going to come into a platform with lesser money which is not the premium pricing what's producer or the finance is getting for that particular film but they are getting there. They can experience the film without the exclusivity because it's already in theater but theatrically and theoretically the film didn't do that much success. But apparently the Jews hit success in a digital platform. Then people are all coming and watching it. So in Indian scenario, what I'm telling you is that anything which is free, anything which has got discount people will always have an intimation.
1661580056.0-1661624024.0
Okay? So like our side, we have also requested the film chamber and the distributors association that saying that there should be a model where you keep the premium pricing for the weekends but weekdays reduce the pricing by 50%. And because, you know, then because none of the films are full houses in weekdays so reduce the ticketing for 50% and make a try and also give them like in America there is a coupon system where you go through an application. You have like abundant like, you know, in every six months you can watch twelve films or 13 films. So this is transferable.
1661624072.0-1661645796.0
Also you make a system something like that. So that more of the people who have built this movie going because movie going it's a culture. It's a culture actually because if it vanishes slowly, people will also when TV came in, people feel they felt that okay, now TV is there. Now what is the reason for world being watching theater? It's not about that.
1661645818.0-1661683200.0
I'm talking about the culture to be active for that culture to prevail. So this will all change now it is a scenario. Most COVID people has got lots of apprehensions also because COVID has not subsided down and still cases are still getting reported and people are also getting sick. So some of the people who are having old age people in their houses, small children in their houses will have apprehensions. That is for sure for them also to give an assurance and get them back to theaters where need to be an extra added value in that they also feel that there is an experience, there is a unique thing which should not be missed.
1661683780.0-1661711640.0
I will tell you an example. In India we only have few IMAX screens. Proper IMAX screens I'm talking about. So whenever this IMAX films, proper IMAX films comes into either about Chennai or Bombay these theaters are always full because people want to watch this kind of experience in an IMAX. So that's the same situation with theatrical also it's not about the regular thing what we are used to.
1661711710.0-1661734930.0
It's about something which is new. They should also feel that okay, this I haven't seen this. I have to get this experience. I have to really sit in the theater, dedicate myself and watch it where only they will feel that peaceful like whatever is having said and then they will get that satisfied feeling. So our maximum choice is to give them that kind of a unique experience.
1661737540.0-1661766204.0
Now I have a question about talents from different industries working together. Like we have director Padapali working with in Kamal for Next film. So you're working with Kamal Hassan sir next. And when you see things like this, do you see all of these boundaries erasing? Do you think that will influence this different thing that Malayalam industry has?
1661766242.0-1661794016.0
Like you said, it's different from other industries. But as the boundaries go down, do you think that the way that the industry is currently working will change? And how do you think people within the industry will work towards this and adapt to these changes? First of all, now we have reached a point where cinema is becoming universal. Language itself is becoming universal.
1661794128.0-1661810100.0
So take for example our Phillips. We have never tried. There are lots of films which are dubbed in all languages. I agree to that point. But still, if you look at some of our films we have never tried dubbing for a film like Malayn Guna in Tamil or Telangu or Hindi.
1661810180.0-1661860948.0
But we are getting good responses from outside also because with subtitles people are all used to watch content. And if that's the same situation which is made in a different scenario is watched with English subtitles in India, it is not a problem for them. Also, another thing is that a director can only function if the sensibilities match. Like whatever new thing which is I have to tell. So if the sensibilities match with the creator then there should be a way where he or she can explore into a new territory and tell a different story and tell a different perspective from whatever stories they need to explore.
1661861044.0-1661888560.0
So there is creative liberty everywhere. So it's not about one filmmaker is only stuck or restricted to the specific industry. No, there's no restrictions in India. So when you are say now that you're working for Rach, come the production house. So when you get approached by outside production houses the first thing that you see is this essential?
1661889300.0-1661902070.0
And then you work people. So how is your personal experience been of discovering a new territory per se? How has that been?
1661904120.0-1661919804.0
Rascal is not a new territory for me because I have been edited. I have an editor, I've been editing and I know Kamala for a long time. I've known him since 2010. I know him. So it's more than twelve years now.
1661919922.0-1661935936.0
So it is very easy for us to communicate. Also, he's a great teacher. For me, I've learned a lot of things from me. We are good friends, we discuss films. It's not that whatever stories, what I have, I also share with him, with them.
1661935958.0-1661983616.0
And he also shares some of his stories with them. So it's a mutual thing. So I never think that I'm going into an alien space and working there. It is not that he's giving me a freedom where he's giving me kind of a confidence where to come up in that industry and then make a film with him. So for me, something which is on Kamala's viewpoint, Kamala's perspective, how he thinks a lot, it's always a learning every moment which I say, for example, even today, if we have some time and interact in Chennai or some other place I normally go, because that's an experience for me.
1661983638.0-1662003868.0
So in that manner, I never felt that I'm going into Navy Ball. The thing is, when I'm going into Bollywood and I am doing something in Hindi, then that's different. That's different because that is a new territory for me. Then I have to like my sensibility should match and then something else should come up and that's different here. It's as simple as making a moral.
1662004064.0-1662032450.0
It's not that difficult for me. Okay, so now that you've brought up editing for Kamalas and Vishalu Kamanal, there are films that you have edited over the years. And today when you see how the films are being edited, do you want to maybe sit on the edit table and just edit any film? Do you still have that tendency to work on a film that's just an editor? Because that's what you started as.
1662034820.0-1662049892.0
I've never stopped editing. Last year I visited Nyata film. Film? I visited that and even during COVID times, Kamasa actually directed a music video with all the ensemble of all the singers and all. I edited that.
1662049946.0-1662076348.0
So it's not like when I stopped that craft, I am still learning with that craft. So sometimes if I have time and that's what I told you in the beginning, I do only one film, one process at a time. People say I do multitasking, but multitasking also remains in a particular aspect that I can do only one craft at a time. It's not that I can dive into all those sorts of things and then expose it. To write a film, I need time.
1662076434.0-1662093804.0
To conceptualize a film, I need time. To sit on an edit, I need time. So that's what I tell normally to my directors also. That is, sometimes they will get hurt and insulted in the sense they will get offended saying that okay, you don't have time. I will tell them openly I don't have time just because I'm writing something.
1662093862.0-1662115370.0
I don't know whether I will realize this film or I'll get funding for this film and I don't know. But right now I'm just trying to write a film so they will understand these things. So that's not an issue. And most of the times, if I'm free, I'm always opening features. So it's not that I've stopped it.
1662116800.0-1662157556.0
So because we have this campaign called Niagara happening currently with Independence Day. So this is one question that I want to end my round tables with. It's about one thing that you want Malayalam industry to retain and one thing you want film industry to change for the future. So retaining Malayalam cinema was always preserving the value of the content with its honesty. Honesty in terms I am not talking in terms of some people will get off and saying that, no, it's not that every film has got an honesty.
1662157588.0-1662176776.0
Like, you know, if it's a mask masala also there is an honesty towards it. Like, you know, you are hitting the right audience. So that's what like, you know, just for the sake of money making mentality alone, I don't think Malala Sama has never produced films. Like there are ups and downs. There are so that is the nature of the industry.
1662176808.0-1662211512.0
So in that manner, I can still say that that's the kind of quality what the industry is always there. And what I told you about something called trust between people, technicians and actors. So there's a trust. So one story, if somebody doesn't like that and that particular actor will again, if the director and actor are friends, he will the acronyms recommend that particular story to a different actor telling that, okay, I am not in the space to do that, but I think that story works. But better you listen to the story like that, it happens.
1662211646.0-1662257208.0
And I'm sure some other industries also have the same curve of an equation. And what you ask next is that changing is that I often feel that Manila industry is an industry where we never tried to go for 100 crore, 200 crore, that kind of a collection value. We have never tried that industry so pure just because it has both got that balance of very independent films, very midstream cinema and very commercial cinema, see all kind of films. Cinema has got that acceptance in that industry. People used to watch also.
1662257374.0-1662282864.0
And I still feel all these films should exist. Like, it's not about like one industry going into chasing for Crow crow. It's not about Crow Club. It's about like, you know, sometimes a film works, sometimes the film doesn't work, it doesn't mean anything. But at least an industry should have all sorts of films to coexist and collaborate so that everybody will have work and everybody's aesthetics also.
1662283062.0-1662298580.0
Then only what you said in the beginning sensibilities are changing in terms of viewing also, like people's sensibilities. So we also have to push something, push our boundaries and tell them that, okay, we are also trying something new. Please come and watch in the theaters.
1662301560.0-1662334352.0
My request is always to people in that manner to come and watch films in theaters. So it will be helping for a lot of people in terms of to push a boundary, to make a film to the next level, to bring some kind of an experience. We can still hang on to that. Well, this is an eye opening conversation for me about the industry and about filmmaking itself. Thank you so much for coming on for this long.
1662334406.0-1662341010.0
Thank you, Brenda. Thank you, Brenda. Thank you so much. All the best. I'm hoping to see all your thank you.
1662342180.0-1662342556.0
Bye.

Namashkar and welcome to one more edition of a conversation on Hulkay.com. Hulk is India's own social media platform. Made in India, made for the world.
1659476450.0-1659481150.0
This is a conversation about towards a new India.
1659483210.0-1659508480.0
A new India where food security is going to be very important. Today we are talking about feeding a hungry India shortages to surplus. This is part of the nayador conversations which Kulke is happening having on this platform.
1659510690.0-1659538150.0
We look at how India has done from 1947 till now by way of food security and food independence. And in times to come, how will India fare in the terms of food security, nutritional security and the health of India's citizens.
1659540730.0-1659609280.0
Meri Sathe mahan Sajjan meri Sat dr. Mangala Rai plant Breeder Agriculture Scientist indian Council of Agriculture Research Director General Ray Mangla rai Sabki under Hindustan Food Security hasil kerry Pacha sal Sejada Agriculture namashkar. Dr. Mangla Rai always a delight speaking to you. It is such a pleasure whenever I talk to you and you always leave me with so much energy.
1659609890.0-1659625940.0
So thanks a lot for joining us. And Dr. Dai, let us start with today. Is India food secure today? Thank you very much for this opportunity.
1659626790.0-1659670580.0
It's indeed always a great pleasure to have conversation with you. In one sense, yes, we are selfsufficient, we are exporting, we have surpluses, we have bakht food stock. But for me, I would consider that it is not only the availability but the economic access, the ecological access to food that in my mind is a paramount security. So if there is acceleration in economy, we would essentially require much more to produce. That's the kind of situation which I would like.
1659672710.0-1659706518.0
But on a very general term, are we producing enough today? Yes, of course. Because we have started exporting even food grains. I remember when I was today 11th class is today. At that point of time, I remember a slogan used to be very popular on the streets and at that time the food grain was not edible.
1659706614.0-1659751820.0
So label used to be had and food grains used to be collected from a rural area. And witnessing my weeding in my home and we used to look we were sick to mouth and we used to look for when the weed will land at Indian pool. That was the kind of situation I recall when I was a child at that point of time, the kind of rice drives to have that we call Satya because the entire area was a rainfare. It was a vein, fred dependent every culture which were not.
1659755390.0-1659771870.0
And it was indeed extremely difficult to have to square meetings. And at that point of time, basin appears to create an embracing, very impressive commodity. Today we are exposing Basin rice.
1659774710.0-1659801420.0
And if you look back to rise in fidelity, there are years where we have been exposing to the tune of almost 37 48,000 crores we have started exposing. So these major food commodities which you have started exposing. This is vindication of the situation that we are having enough food to eat at the moment.
1659803550.0-1659843560.0
Now it's a very happy situation where we are exporting food grains, especially basmati in such large numbers going forward. We are in the 75th year of India's independence next 25 years. Like the Prime Minister. Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the Amrit Kal is very crucial. In your opinion, as the agriculture scientist, the thought leader in the sector of food, will we remain food independent and food secure in the next 25 years also?
1659845550.0-1659884862.0
I for one believe and indeed very strongly believe that the challenges are going to be far more than ever before. You will ask me a question as to why. Because we in India are having 17.78% population of the whole world. We have only 4.2% water of the whole year and we have only 2.3% land of the whole year. And on these 2.3% land we have reached 17.78% human population as well as 11% live stock which is available in the country.
1659885016.0-1659933446.0
So the per unit pressure on Indian soil is five to six times more as compared to Earth average. So the challenges are far more. But as a scientist, when I look to the opportunities because more challenges, more opportunity and more opportunity, there is likelihood of far more technology generation and harnessing the potential. So when I look to the various presets of science and technology and the opportunity, I far one believe and indeed very strongly believe that the challenges are certainly likely to be surmountable and we will be able to meet our needs. But we will have to invest in R and DFO far more than ever before.
1659933628.0-1659971058.0
And unfortunately, I have no hesitation whatsoever in my mind that our investment in R and the effort are far below the investment in research, which is 0.3%. China is spending 0.6% and the developed economies are spent in agriculture. Research ratio is more than 3%. So 0.3% developed economy is 3% and the most populous nation of the world is spending 0.3%. So it is far below.
1659971144.0-1660008874.0
We will have to accelerate this pace of investment in the first go. We will have to pay much needed attention on human resource development. If I recall back the year in which you said I have a long term, yes, I have seven years long term at BP and Secretary Government of India. And in 2008, nine, the highest was that I recall zero point 84% of the total brought to this product, which was zero point 91% of GNP. But today it has gone down less than 0.3.
1660008992.0-1660038120.0
So we have to if you look back to the climate change, it will be not accountable to produce more and more with less and less water, energy, soil and soil health is degrading. So if we have to meet the growing needs, which is certainly possible, but investment in RNCO will have to be accelerated as early as possible. Why do you think the government is ignoring it, sir?
1660040970.0-1660081474.0
Hopefully, yes. I have no hesitation in my mind. The investment in R and holds is much below the desired level. And if you look to the set for example the indoor Gangnetic Alluvian, which is today almost right from Gangtik West Bengal to Bihar to Jharkhand to which is the bowel, and in this bowel there is 50% precipitation as on date 50% less. So if you look back to the Asian Climate Change report on a vulnerability scale on zero to ten, this Indomiti canobium is at nine.
1660081592.0-1660129460.0
So this very clearly indicates carbon contained in the soil is just half. In Punjab and Ryan soil, when green devolution started it was 0.5%, but today it is zero point 25%. And we all know it is not only the nutrients which we externally apply, but it is the very basic carbonic matter, the very basic carbon contained in the soil, because 80% to 90% soil biological process determine the productivity. And therefore if there is no carbon, soil biota would get adversely affected and consequently the very basic resilience of agriculture and total factor productivity is bound to decelerate. And therefore these are important factors which essentially require to be addressed to.
1660131450.0-1660155020.0
You pointed out some very important things essentially that soil carbon, organic carbon is decreasing and that is a deeply worrying fact. We will come back to that. Let me take ask you once again see the government is very aware of what the situation is. Very soon we will be the most populous nation of the world.
1660157090.0-1660183778.0
Why is the government not investing more in research and development in agriculture? Why is the investment at such a low level? Very simple. Because gas station period in agriculture is long. Say for example, if you want to develop a variety from where you start crossing now marker assistance, breeding and biotechnocultal tools have reduced the period.
1660183874.0-1660262080.0
But even then, if you go on and on and every eight, nine years is essentially required to develop a variety and then you start testing them in multilocation trial for its suitability and deductibility in different region, situation and system. And once you come to a logical confusion that the actual variety is better than other, then you go for seed production, nuclear seed breather, seed foundation seed certified, then in 14th years or 15th years it reaches the former. And therefore this gas station period is one issue which in my best judgment and you see the path the thorough complicancy either agara in India food security is an integral part of the national security. Correct.
1660265490.0-1660310080.0
Independent policy investment on returns is one of the most important criteria. Agarap agriculture may investment on the returns made under the this is one of the highest and therefore don't find any reason.
1660325430.0-1660373790.0
And therefore not only it will ensure food and lesser security, but it would provide much needed job security or job security kalava Be unless and until a grow ecosystem efficiently and effectively revolve into the ecosystem. For ecosystem services we will not be able to start on a long term sustainable basis. And therefore for ecological violence, for environmental violence, for job opportunities, for Social Security, for inclusive growth. Agriculture must receive deprived everything can weigh, but not agriculture.
1660393530.0-1660447610.0
Millennium development still food security continues a far cry or the detoriation environment soil mayor the detoriation water mayor the production parameters may detour you say detour date, total factor productivity or receipt current or the receipt currently. So for having the same amount of production, you will have to provide much more use. For example, when we started Green Revolution at that point of time we used to give one kg and PV and we used to harvest 50 kg of peak. Last year, when I was doing the lecture, I saw the data. It has come down to five kg, 50 KD to five kg for one KD and PK.
1660452750.0-1660516510.0
Now it has come down three KD situation and we have to be alive of the situation. The nutritional imbalances of rampant so LPK imbalance after micronutrients secondary nutrients they are indeed very serious. Or I got 12% of GDP minerals in a supplement has a very product and voice and agriculture essentially required to be seen in perspective, in its entirety and fatality which it deserves.
1660657250.0-1660672080.0
Growth rate spectacular achievement varieties development for accelerated program.
1660749610.0-1660838870.0
Same is true as far as concern flower, we have hybrid, we are first, it's a different matter that how much she is being produced and how much is being taken to the farmer.
1660841690.0-1660877970.0
But as far as research is concerned, with limited resources spectacular. I would call it spectacular development. Because of her commitment of the people, because of the commitment of the scientists, technician, farmer and overall policy maker. From day one till today policy maker have been behind the scene and they have been quite supportive. Would you say that the nudge for the Green Revolution really made so much difference for India in becoming food secure?
1660879510.0-1660908190.0
The question is, as I was mentioning, green Revolution was called as a revolution from where this name came. A meeting was going on in the United States of America at that point of time. In China there was a red revolution. In India there was peace, prosperity and tranquility. And therefore this name was quite from there and it was clean and it was green and therefore there was peace and prosperity.
1660908930.0-1660990946.0
But I would say that other things which are not being talked about. This Green Revolution has evolved into a rainbow revolution. You see the fish production, you see milk production, you see the air production, you see the poultry production, you see vegetable, you see proof. Now we facility as the country may round the year. Vegetables are available at almost affordable prices.
1660991058.0-1660995160.0
Now we have varieties tomato we are producing at 40, 44.
1660998030.0-1661046970.0
You name a variety poly houses, panicarita, precision agriculture. So there is virtually far greater revolution than the green revolution. The only point is at that time our berry was empty, so there was a lot more appreciation. Today we are full, so we are not fighting at the part, but sometimes fighting is absolutely essential so that you work for these patience and persistence to achieve at higher goals which would be absolutely required. One of the consequences of the Green revolution has been this cycle of rice and wheat which has come through in the granary or the northwestern part of India.
1661047310.0-1661106622.0
Do you think this over dependence on rice and wheat and the second generation downstream issues of green revolution need to be addressed very quickly. The question is what is more resilient? What is that which is less affected by the environmental fluctuations and weather? What is more resilient to insect pest and diseases are much more vulnerable. And we see the simple statistics hardly we analyze when this green revolution came rise with as you rightly said 1011 million hectare area has gone into this system and 5 million hectare area from pulses from Northern India area remains for pulses the same.
1661106676.0-1661160960.0
But 5 million got reduced and in the center and peninsular region and palava petro takan floto this pulsate has been pushed in rented area bartinal area into this carbon condition for production. But the question is you will have to diversify this system as much as possible if you want to maintain the soil health. We are siphoning and mining nutrients in army we are providing almost 20 million tons of nutrients and we are siphoning and mining almost 30 million tons from India 140 42 million hectare which continue to be in production. I would like to remind that in 50s we used to produce in 140 42 million hectare. Today also we are producing in 140 42 million population has gone three and half times.
1661161970.0-1661194650.0
But you have a buffer stock, my friend, you are exporting, that is what this right is. But diversification and for diversification there are certain policy incarnatives which you have to bring into. At the same time you have to appreciate the environmental cost which is essentially required in our pricing mechanism. As for milk, you are giving milk price based on fat percentage. At the same time you are not giving how much protein.
1661195150.0-1661220506.0
Agriculture is simply the conversion of solar energy by means of a biological system marketable. So solar energy gets converted into chemical form of energy. For converting that chemical for your grain food, your powder, your fruit, your vegetable. So you have to give energy. But for converting that energy for protein, almost four times more energy is required.
1661220698.0-1661267870.0
Hyatt conversion, almost eight times more energy is required and you are going into input star condition these drop and you want that it should compete and compete effectively. At the same time you are not giving the work week for example, if you are giving attah Bin habaya in Brazil and america soya meal is the main product, soya oil is the byproduct. And my friend Mr. Bagla in India soya oil is main product and Soyami is byproduct. Despite the fact that 40% Indians are protein energy malnaries correct.
1661267940.0-1661313070.0
Why does it change the policy based on Haxane based production? Why can't you use the bead for fortification of various products and process? I know hundreds and hundreds products similarly maze I know 1000 different kind of uses of base and you are producing bays in VR supplying base and rapids and rapids is producing air and that age is being brought about in VR. So why don't you look into similarly ALCI there are cakes, these are all going at throwaway prices if you use them a five star culture.
1661316850.0-1661347590.0
So if you give so called by product has the capability to become main so other main or so called bimev value addition, diversified product development processing in Costab Jordan is to make a profitable venture with that. At the same time other pulsate of growth or ten which you are not accounting in economics the very basic soil health, the very basic nitrogen situation, the very basic soil organisms.
1661351950.0-1661426286.0
So the question is if you look back to the entire thing in its entirety and totality and you provide say for example you are referring to my bagdindraham and special duty on all technology mission on all seat I was specially called upon. And do you know what happened from 1.8 million headquarters we brought down the four to .2 million tons from 1.82.2 within three four years and our production went up from ten and a half million to 18.3 million tons in three years. Now, question is despite the fact that we have gone more than 30 million you have to look into the policy in paradise and the situation then why we have gone to 15 million tons of import as one of these. So you have to look into the regions as to what is happening, how it is happening. But I'm very happy although delayed but the action is taken and taken on oil farm in northeast where about 11,000 crore has been put there in 4.6 million Ha plantation.
1661426398.0-1661476398.0
If you are having right kind of material and if you look to its management for two to three years and ensure its procurement and timely processing, this would be indeed a revolution. So there are projects, there are programs and if they are put in right perspective but here the basic question diversification of the production system, particularly in Dover relationship fault farm and there you will have to look into areas including economic. You mentioned about oil palms and oil seed where we are still deficient in we are still importing. The same thing applies to pulses. We are still importing pulses.
1661476494.0-1661495654.0
Isn't that shameful? I would not call it a shameful. I'm calling what a commendable job has been done. You have to appreciate in the right perspective we don't analyze the total situation. My friend China was not growing PSNP they have taken from us.
1661495692.0-1661526754.0
And my friend PSNP was not being grown in Kenya. Kenya is producing PSNP and it is my friend Chickpea was not there in Australia, chickpea was not in Canada. Now they are producing. So you analyze what has gone wrong and where now we were producing almost 90% having 90% den of the whole world. At the same time we were having almost 70% chickpea of the whole world.
1661526872.0-1661548486.0
But have we done that much? RMD a code as far as these cross is concerned. You have to search your heart and you have to come to a logical confusion where you have invested, where you have put in faces. You have and I just mentioned, india is the only country in the whole world which have hybrids. Nobody else has.
1661548588.0-1661568190.0
And right, from four or five months to 264 65 days, So the question is there are opportunities to invest and harness the potential.
1661570230.0-1661571700.0
There are also questions.
1661575430.0-1661623970.0
At that time I was coordinator pratina was the only variety first variety Hudal Singh Sanposika Kampun which was powder in midweek. Before that all varieties were susceptible to powdering mildew and this field pee was almost wiped out from them. But Ratna came and today fella. That is why I said we should be proud of all the variety not one variety in India field piece there which is not consistent policy that's the contribution of our scientists and a great contribution. Give a child, give them opportunity and little bit fight at the back even if you don't very sorry of fighting at the back because people are very sorry in fighting at the back.
1661624120.0-1661691430.0
Give at least little resources to them to do better and they can do wonder. No, I am very much in tune with the fact that without having had the kind of support from agriculture scientists we could not have become independent. You mentioned about how dependent our decisions were when we were living ship to mouth or on food imports. Today I'm climate change, climate resilient, climate smart, agriculture.
1661695550.0-1661727620.0
First I would like to mention about the initial and which I left and about the climate change, my friend after my retirement China has awarded leadership congress and they had invited me from India after my retirement. So professor Zai, he was hating that. He said doctor, I have a budget increase in India. I said I wanted five times, I have got two and a half times. He said Dr, I wanted 15 times and I have got 15 times.
1661728150.0-1661787442.0
This is the difference. Having said that, I would like to mention that there was support, there is continuing support. But the question is the way climate change in 2000 years how much temperatures increased in two right hand pre industrial industrial period it was almost 34 degrees Celsius and in 100 years it was almost zero six. In this it is almost one degree celsius it is contemplated to be 1.5 to two degree Celsius index by the end of the century. If that happens, the requirement of water, the requirement of fertilizer would be increased and there will be many more areas where decelerate.
1661787586.0-1661831674.0
But there are certain crops, say for example, maze, as I mentioned, a crop like maze, which is seafood, more carbon dioxide, more likely to be photosynthesis, so there would be greater opportunity, but this would require investment and far greater research. In soil for soil health, 60% waters are either polluted or getting degraded. We are having so much water in Chirappovian around but I was there, there is no water harvesting. For the second, a country like soil with em rate precipitation is about 435 in a year. What is water use efficiency?
1661831742.0-1661894194.0
My friend, there more than 80% water use efficiency water is the water use efficiency in India and lesser state is better maybe 50% and what about the water harvesting? 30 31% water which is going is going to the sea. And along with this, on an average out of 329,000,000 hectare, which is the total you're graphical area of this country eight to ten tons of soil is getting eroded each year. And where slopes, hill slopes and hill tops where depending on the degree more the degree more with the water along with the water and wind erosion and therefore the soil erosion car contained reduction, nutritional imbalances, lack of processing, product development, valuation, marketing and trade lack of historic lack of remunerating prices. At times it becomes more production, more lost, less production, less loss.
1661894242.0-1661950410.0
No production, low loss. If that is the kind of situation why you are thinking so in tomato when there is much more production it goes to 55 kg and when there is Rs80 so there are more flux and there are swings and the swings are enormous and these swings enormous. For a big vigorous man who is having lot of capital it is possible to absorb. But holdings as you were talking Indian holdings were 2.28 ha average holding size in 70 71 today it is 1.1 almost 1 ha is half and number of holdings have doubled. Those are the challenges how can you bring the algorithm production system to enhance network productivity would depend on the profitability, it would depend on the sustainability.
1661950750.0-1661990470.0
It would have to bank upon the venture which can sustain the farm family and livestock and if you do that and help the farmers to be on their own feet I have no reason that big small holders farmer would also learn the very basic phenomena of aggregation and segregation. And with the aggregation and segregation, my friend, we have forgotten. We have forgotten when I go to Java John F. Kennedy airport there is a board, my friend and that's the difference we have to learn. There it is.
1661990540.0-1662017310.0
And the Iranian culture is simply cut at the fact that means the farmer at that time us farmer, US farmer, purchased everything in retail and sense everything in wholesale. They are much bigger farmer. So the pinch is there. And here this small holder farmer by small holder farmer, everything he purchased in retail.
1662026610.0-1662112266.0
So the question of aggregation and segregation, the question of retailing and wholesale, the question of historian, the question of transportation, the question of marketing, the question of trade, the question of say for example in rainfad agriculture you are having almost 70% war of the whole world produced in India diversified product. The work or the produce would not be available to the farmer and consequently the pie farmer would be high and dry. The very basic despite the fact that tremendous improvement has been brought about. But far more could have been done if we could have addressed this whole economic change efficiently, effectively, far more than ever before we need to do this. So there are some questions which have come from the audience which is asking what is your opinion on nano?
1662112298.0-1662141160.0
Urea. As I actually there are people who say that it is giving much more productivity. But you have to very efficiently look into the very basic experimentation that is it thriving on the very basic reserve which is available. Because if it is on the reserve it is thriving and increasing the efficiency. Then you have to revisit and rebook it, the whole situation.
1662144170.0-1662168110.0
One doctor Gomer may be from Ariana Agriculture University later. So that probably essentially required. So there will be some scientific discussion between the card form. So many people say hundred kg bags. Now, if Co is saying is equivalent to one half liter bottle, is that scientifically feasible?
1662169910.0-1662215294.0
The question is these are required to be experimented upon. Hopefully they might have done experimentation, but as far as the say for example fatiguetion and fatigation with nanovir and sprains which you are likely to do is bound to be much more effective. But how much that is a question which is required to look into on case to case basis by effective experimentation. Hopefully they have done if they have not done the relationship required to do. There's one more question which has come from Karthik, who's asking the hot potato question should MSP be stopped now?
1662215332.0-1662247160.0
The question is Professor Swaminathan committee report came into Meghi government has said C two plus 50%. Hopefully they might have looked into. So if they have looked into and farmers are demanding generation from where MSP came into it was 1965.
1662252990.0-1662317120.0
At that point in time the Group Corporation of India came into being and dismissed to be taken from country and from there it has served this country indeed extremely well. And particularly where there has been swings for small holder, it has not only provided and good security to the people, particularly for the PDS system. If you look to the PDF system, almost 800 million people are driving on system at the moment. So this is indeed massive and almost 20% people is still malnourished. There are problems with insecure people and therefore in that context but this PDF Punjab and Haryana used to have retained rise and ambulances used to be riled, but in rest of the country PDS was not able to make much media.
1662317570.0-1662361870.0
So the question is do essentially make it broad based into other production processes core cereal pulses. Why I say core serial simply because of the fact that in 2000 you were having 64% of the food requirements by the food. By 2025 you are estimated to be fifty seven k and by 2050 you are estimated to have about 38K. Meaning thereby that this requirement will be met from the animal based protein. And for animal based protein you will need much more livestock production.
1662362210.0-1662411520.0
Therefore the compound growth rate for rice and wheat, even if it is less than 2%. But for feed grains it would require almost 5%. So the question is it is essentially required to remove in its entirety and fatality in its context. And once you make a commitment 50% then there is no reason why you should not honor, if you make a commitment, that you are going to double the yield of the farmer, despite the fact knowing fully while that there are numerous variables, these variables are not in your control. But if you are making a commitment, then you adorate reasons as to why you should not.
1662412930.0-1662478100.0
So one more question which has come to me offline from a student is what is your view on India adopting genetically modified food crops? Paula, you are also quite old, but certainly younger than you in the year 2000. In the year 2000 the first book Transgenics in agriculture was written by Union Russian. It was simply because of the fact that far more awareness by the Shinji required. And the first transgenic was disease for commercial cultivation pulse I would like to remind that 50 55% in sites of the whole country used to do only for controlling helicopter madra in water eight is sprayed, nine is sprayed synthetic parasites used to be used discomfort swati as per Kate or Baker and having pronounced in it what happened, my friend?

Don't you remember that 50 years back we were having pesticides using bacillus thorandenis whose gene has been cooking? Therefore, in my best judgment, whether you like or you don't like, with the climate change which is taking place, transgenic culture in agriculture is bound to the order of the say for example, one degree temperature, one and half degree, two degree. I was mentioning that this much would be required. There are certain microbes which thrives at 113 degree Celsius. Can't they be cloned and those genes can't be deployed?

Theoretically it is possible, and this is doable at the same time there are many species with a 00:50. Can those genes not be cloned and transferred so that you produce more with less and less water? Say for example, there are many. Species in the sea which types in the sea water. Can those genes not be cloned and deployed across these kingdoms?

It is possible. So Bashuddhar Kutambukam wife husband Bashuddhavukam is there no barrier to gene flow across plant and animal and microbial kingdom? That is what Basudae Kutukam is all about. If you look back to human genomics as well as the rice genomics, you will find 70 80% genes are common. Your adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosines four bases and your sugar and phosphate all are nonline.

So when these bases get tied down to sugar and phosphate, these nucleotides in different permutation and combination these to the genetic constellation and with interaction with the environment it produces a kind of character. So we have to understand the very basic science in its entirety and fatality.

70% diseases are from 70% plus diseases are from human to animal and animal to human monkey pop but do we have applied form yahi human genomics animal science 109 vaccines commercialized 19 vaccines in India and people never talk about these animal scientists have done a commendable job which this country is proud of. There was a time when we used to not only do research but produce vaccine 95% for the whole country. Today we developed vaccine and since private sector had developed so we produce only 5% 95% our vaccine and other vaccines have produced private sector. So the question is we have to have a plate farm for genetic diseases. We have not learn relation even from Kovi now monkey parks many more these microorganisms do not recognize passports and political boundaries much better and our medical institute scientists CRISPR technology is the technology which is going to change the spectrum of R and D efforts and variety development and accelerated food.

I for one, when I was board of Governors at Erie, my name rises C three plant. Let us start research. Why can't C three plant be converted to C four plant? So that opportunity to convert more convent dioxide and India will have to have a cutting edge science and technology if we have to have a leadership global. It is always such a delight listening to you, Dr.

Manglai. Despite some of the very difficult and harsh things you said, you still leave the audience and me with so much hope that we have delivered on the food security front in the last 75 years of India's independence. And also that in the coming years our scientists will be able to deliver and give India more food security and nutritional security. Both are required and like you said, not just green revolution but the rainbow revolution which we have seen in the country. I think the country needs to be more humble and respectful towards agriculture scientists like yourself, who have given India so much for getting so little in returns and yet giving India that independent voice through that strength of food security, climate change of climate smart agriculture.

1655316090.0-1655339070.0
Thanks so much, Nichol, for making the time. I know you had a busy day today, but I'm glad we can have you here. So, Nichols, tell us, I've always been very curious about this. Where did your journey start? I think you are the latest entrant, the last member of Indian Ocean.
1655341290.0-1655373134.0
Been in the band almost ten years now, so that is already quite a while. But, yeah, in terms of the band being a 35 year old band, I think the oldest band currently active in India. So I'm the most recent entrant, and well, music for me started when I was a teenager and I didn't really take many lessons, not formally. And that happens to be, I think, true of most people who end up playing for bands. Most people are self taught, and not only here.
1655373172.0-1655398658.0
I think most guitar players, people who gravity towards rock music, tend to be, well, mostly self taught. You find a guitar, you connect with the sound. As a teenager, you think it's cool. So I just started, I think, when I was in class nine or ten, and somebody, one guy in my class was playing guitar, and I thought that was the coolest thing. We were all into bands like Guns and Roses and Aerosmith and Metallica, and he showed me a couple of cards.
1655398754.0-1655418226.0
I was doing that and then went on. When you go to college I went to an engineering college in Gujarat. So you get few more opportunities to play music there's, cultural festivals, you meet people who have been doing music. So that, I think, was when the world starts opening up a little bit. Very tantifically.
1655418278.0-1655441060.0
Started playing some small live gigs, battle of the band competitions. I think it starts that way for most people. College tests and zonal festivals, university festivals, and you just get into that whole thing. And it was for me, I never really thought of it as a profession, but I just kept doing it just out of the because it was fun. And that's how I got kind of started.
1655443050.0-1655457610.0
What kind of engineering were you studying? Yeah, I studied chemical engineering, and my first job was actually at the petroleum refinery in Jamnagar.
1655460030.0-1655478560.0
I can take a wild guess there are two there, but that's exciting. And you weren't even at that time in a metro city. How were you keeping up with music there? Were you playing? Were you getting a chance to explore music?
1655479270.0-1655507114.0
Yeah, well, I think we had cassettes, mixed tapes we borrowed. I mean, we didn't really even have CDs. And well, I would say the Internet was there, but it was very slow and we didn't really use it until the mid 2000s when it really exploded. I was an obsessive collector of cassettes and making lists. And if you follow, like, my Metallica was my favorite bad.
1655507152.0-1655552274.0
So I would make a list of try to find every little bit of article that I could on them, try to understand their story, what their albums were. And I would just make lists and try to buy cassettes in whatever when we could go to Mdbad or go to Bombay. So that's how we're very excited. And I think some of that is lost right now in this era of, you know, everything all you can eat buffets and spotlight is that simple thing of waiting to save Rs95 for three months and then buying a cassette and saving it for six months. I think, well, it could be an old nostalgic until talking, but I think all of this was a lot more meaningful to us just because we were so constrained with the resources.
1655552322.0-1655576026.0
So we just enjoyed everything that much more, I think. Did you get to watch shows as well or? I'm very curious to know if you were watching Indian Ocean back then. Yeah, not so much, actually. So Amdabad was a place that was, and even now is served off live entertainment.
1655576218.0-1655589440.0
One of the key reasons for that being that the state has prohibition, so there's not so many pubs and clubs and bars, but we would wait. Like, I think growing up I would have seen two, three, four shows.
1655603550.0-1655622670.0
I'm glad you are finally able to make it. I was just talking to Nikhil about his early years. I realized he doesn't come from a musical background at all and he was talking about his chemical engineering days and work in Jamnagar.
1655625170.0-1655657114.0
That's quite exciting to know. So, yeah, you were saying there was not too much opportunity to watch the band or any other yeah, not so many shows. They were one or two local bands and when you're in school you think, well, being in a band is the coolest thing you can do with your life. So I had a couple of seniors, people who are three, four years ahead of me, and they had a band and they used to do covers of OSS and Green Day and I was like, oh my God, when I go to college, I want to be in a brand also. In fact, when I was in college, I saw Indian Ocean once and that was a big deal for us.
1655657232.0-1655670634.0
We went to Baroda and this was 2003 or four maybe. I think they were they were really on top of their game. They were doing some fantastic music accent. So I saw the band then. Yeah.
1655670832.0-1655680750.0
Little little. Do you know that you get to tour with the guys many years later? Yeah. And Tohina has disappeared again. Your bank.
1655683990.0-1655700070.0
I want to ask you the same question. I know yours is a very different story, but how did you start out in music? In your case? You come from a musical family, so when did you start and when did you know you were going to take this up professionally?
1655702410.0-1655760950.0
So how did I start? My father is a drummer who wanted to be a tablor player when he was young, but he was already so busy professionally that he could not pursue when I was in class. Third, that is when Guruji said I was already playing Congo and Bongo in my father's band.
1655763290.0-1655764520.0
How old were you?
1655796170.0-1655839470.0
I started playing some gigs here and there with someone some different people met with an accident, head injury. I wasn't I was in train from Bangalore to Delhi.
1655898810.0-1655904790.0
But why tabla? You were saying that your father played the drums.
1655994730.0-1656005180.0
That's the one instrument, percussion instrument that you haven't tried? No, I don't think I should ever try that.
1656014030.0-1656019630.0
Traditional art forms are really challenging and grueling and I think impossible without the blessings of the Guru.
1656024530.0-1656027470.0
He is a melodic instrument player.
1656045930.0-1656067722.0
Nikkil, I also am interested in knowing what happened after. When did you quit your job? Was it to join the band, or had you realized earlier that music was your calling? Well, I'm sure we'll get to that in a bit. And there are more reasons why most people do not pick music as a career.
1656067786.0-1656095186.0
And traditional middle class upbringing, sales music don't really pursue this professionally for me also because I really never grew up with any musician. I knew no musicians growing up. Everybody in my family was doctors and engineers. Okay. So I had it was almost like you just on autopilot, read the script, and it just keeps unfolding.
1656095218.0-1656119258.0
Kia upkaro. I got a student or two, engineering masters, US, telejao, and then you can set yourself up for a good life, that kind of thing. So I was doing music, and I didn't really enjoy my first job. And I was missing college, I was missing my friends. So kind of I quit that job, and I thought, okay, I'll prepare with some exams.
1656119274.0-1656136866.0
I'll go to the US. I'll get another degree because Abuto has a bachelor's degree, masters. So, anyway, all things considered, I was actually in Singapore. I had registered to do a PhD in materials science and engineering. So I was studying that, and I was two years into my research program.
1656136968.0-1656159754.0
And it so happened that I was not able to finish my PhD, because my marriage is a PhD guide. He decided to quit the university and said, I can't stay on you because you'll take at least three more years to do this. And I was looking at some tough choices back then. I was thinking that, what do I do? I was running out of scholarship money.
1656159792.0-1656170814.0
I was running out of funding. Because the academic life comes with its own set of pressures, right? Yeah, I can imagine. I was in Singapore and thinking of, okay, I'll look for a job. Okay.
1656170852.0-1656201350.0
Now I'll go to the US. Do something SMUD. And, well, then it so happened that Indian Ocean, I had met them once before, and my brother Andrew Agraw, who used to work with Indian Ocean as their tour manager, so through him, I had met Indian Ocean once. We played together, we jammed and it went off well. And Amit from the band remembered this and they were in a place where Schmidt San, the founding guitar player of the band, was going to quit.
1656201690.0-1656227546.0
And they decided that okay, we want to try somebody new and young and somebody who's and they liked my style of playing because by then I was interested a lot in Indian music and folk music and fusion music, all kinds of because I think that is a very natural progression. You start off playing rock and then you want to see what else is there. What else is there? Yeah, that had started happening to me. And these guys in Generation said that, let's try, let's see if this fits.
1656227658.0-1656255686.0
And lo and behold, ten years down the line, still doing it. Yeah, you can continue. Did you consider at that point, since you were not formally trained, did you consider formal training at that point? Was there any preparation that went into joining the band at that point? Well, I think I discovered Indian Ocean in my undergrad and they were a big influence on me.
1656255868.0-1656286420.0
And I didn't really take so many formal lessons back then, but just the old school way of learning through imitation. You listen to something on the television or on the radio or on cassettes and try to imitate that. Most guitar players learn that way. But yeah, I did not have too much in the way of professional experience, the whole thing, because yeah, that's one thing. To put up a performance in front of a public is a whole other thing.
1656287670.0-1656313706.0
So I think I just practiced a lot before I joined the band, after I joined the band. Also, it was the summer time, which is usually not such a busy time for musicians and events people. So we had a lot of time. We had about two, three months of preparation and we played a lot back then. I think to him remembers that we did about four or 5 hours of RYA's every day together to gel the sound.
1656313808.0-1656347062.0
I think that it was required and I'm so glad we were able to do it because that practice, even now we are at a stage where people are busy with various things and we are not able to meet so frequently. But the practice you do as a collective. Not just your individual practice, but as a collective that really carries through. And it shows because so many has been walked into the kind of concerts where three or four individuals who are great in isolation. They are phenomenal players, but they come together and the sound of the band has not happened.
1656347196.0-1656352520.0
You feel Solo is telling parallel stories, right? So.
1656355070.0-1656374000.0
That was, I think, the biggest learning for me because everybody is like, oh, wow, you can play. But when you actually play with other musicians, you realize, oh, I always rush. I always play ahead of the beat. I'm always messing up this place. So those things start happening when you play live with.
1656377090.0-1656393540.0
That'S really interesting. I think I find that the contrast here very interesting. You come from starkly different backgrounds musically and yeah, just the coming together of that is wonderful. Tell us your story.
1656396090.0-1656410546.0
You've been at Indian Ocean a little longer than Nikhil right now. Probably a couple of years. Couple of years. So how did Indian Ocean happen for you? How did you end up joining Indian Ocean?
1656410578.0-1656416360.0
And was that ever part of the plan? What was your plan with music? Yeah.
1656440890.0-1656447110.0
So after my college, I was working at a school as a music teacher. Teacher.
1656454090.0-1656525040.0
And I used to play with a couple of bands who was an Indian Ocean also played, and we also performed. Okay. I got in touch with the previous I remember I had called him up, 2009 Copella. You remember the date and all that? Maybe not exactly, but around that time.
1656551290.0-1656569630.0
I've always been curious about this. I want to know what happens when two younger members, you were essentially both recruited by the band and not part of the founding, and both of you replaced founding members. So what was that like? Was there a lot of comparisons?
1656571970.0-1656590820.0
What were you hearing from fans at the time? Because there was a lot of heartbreak. There is a lot of heartbreak when a founding member leaves the band or in this case, a founding member passes away. So what was the dynamics like? How did you sort of make your place in the band for both of you?
1656591750.0-1656611194.0
Well, so that definitely happens. Whether you like it or not, comparisons will always happen. You can avoid them. I think I was made to feel quite comfortable and secure by the band themselves. And they said that you keep doing your thing and you were hired because you had a sound.
1656611232.0-1656646886.0
And yes, of course you have to play Schmidt's guitar parts, but we are not looking for just somebody who can play the old parts. You have to add your own style and sound and individuality to it. They're also looking for somebody who can come up with music, who can compose your music, because they did not want to be Indonesian, did not want to be stuck in the past as a legacy act. That okay. This is a band that was once great, and now they travel the world, perform songs that were hits 20 years ago.
1656647068.0-1656660202.0
Well, of course you have to do the hits every show. You have to. But they also wanted to write new music and develop and go forward and move together. So I think I had a really easy time. I did not expect it to be that easy.
1656660336.0-1656690018.0
Okay. Looking back, I feel that we achieved a significant amount of progress without really having to think about it, because now when I look back on that whole era of me joining the band 2013 to 15. Well, we achieved a lot. We wrote music for a film called Masan, which did really well, which was, I think, the band's most ambitious album to date. Not a bigger album than that.
1656690184.0-1656719600.0
And we did what, some 70, 80 shows a year traveled to maybe 15 different countries. So a lot happened, but it just happened by doing there was no serious thought. And if you talk to the guys in the band, they are very matter of fact. They don't really take themselves too seriously in that sense. They are really unique in the show business because you find a lot of people who will what can I say?
1656721170.0-1656738270.0
They have certain care about what they are, who they are, what their worth. Is, what the value is. And Indian Ocean people are still rooted and live their regular lives with families. They just happen to be great legendary rock stars.
1656765810.0-1656792420.0
But did you also hear things from fans? I mean, I can imagine at that time your compliments also must come from comparison, especially early. Yeah, I heard a lot from also Pratchy. I'll have to wind up in five to ten minutes max. I'm sorry about that because I have no problem.
1656793210.0-1656814826.0
The real life of a musician is that you're in Beckoning. You all right. I think we'll wind up with you quickly, and then I will direct the questions to Tuhim. But I do want you to take a couple of minutes at least and place something for us once you're done answering, if that's all right. Yeah.
1656814848.0-1656853526.0
You were saying about the comparison and compliments. I would hear from longtime friends and supporters of the band who were very warm, and they would be like, okay, because I was into Karnatak music a lot without having formally studying it. So I was very interested by guitar players like Prasana, Drew Ganika, all these people who were trying to adapt Indian classical music onto the guitar. In some sense, Sushma Sen has done that also, being totally self taught. So that was a path that really inspired me and still influences me.
1656853548.0-1656873994.0
And when I'm left by myself, most of the time, that's what I'm doing. I'm trying to play the guitar at home and trying to pull out Indian melodies from my ear because I don't know what it is. It just connects more, I think, than rock at this point in my life. Yeah. So I could hear a lot from fans, and most of them were encouraging.
1656874042.0-1656900550.0
It's possible that the people who hated me were kind enough to never come up to me and say that I'm taking that as a sign. But then you do it enough number of times, and then it becomes your own thing. Right. So you come into your own beyond. After that, you didn't hear a lot of, like, you are doing this exactly like Sue Schmidt or did you get a lot of that initially?
1656901050.0-1656942360.0
Well, I think, yes, some fans tend to be they do not want to accept change. Right, exactly. They don't want to because for them, they connected with the band at a particular point in their lives and they are looking to recreate that nostalgia for themselves. Right. And especially the older fans, I think, because they are not so interested in what is Indian Ocean today because they also progress in their lives and careers and they are looking for some moment of connect with that band they saw in their college festival 20 years ago.
1656943370.0-1656951400.0
And now the band shows up and we play the set, which is kind of that, but almost, I would say 80% different.
1656953690.0-1656981200.0
Besides the popular hits like Bandhay Mareva and Kandisa, I would say that most of the songs we are doing were written in the last eight to ten years. It's a little hard, and I understand that it's a little hard for people to accept that, but that's life. It just keeps happening. What can you do about it who never accepted the new lineup? Probably move on to other things.
1656981890.0-1656998066.0
Right, that's good. I think Nicholl has to leave shortly, so I'm just going to request you to play us something for a bit and then Tina and I will continue talking. Okay? Sure. I'll give you a sneak peek of one of the upcoming songs.
1656998098.0-1657023550.0
Finally, Indianoshan is releasing a new album after a big hiatus. Oh, wow. It's going to come out later this year. So I'll play a small piece in a karnatak rag called Hamsanandi, which we are using on a song called Jungle, which is about loving nature and environmental consciousness. Oh, wow.
1657023620.0-1657025230.0
That's wonderful.
1657138710.0-1657150694.0
Thank you so much. That was wonderful. Thanks for doing that for us. And it was wonderful having you here. Thanks for being on colkey.
1657150742.0-1657169810.0
I hope we have many more conversations in the future. Also, thanks so much. Pleasure. Pleasure. Prachi, thank you once again, not only for this, but over the years for supporting us, for supporting independent music, and I wish you guys a lot of success and will be the next Amazon.
1657170310.0-1657171220.0
Thank you.
1657180870.0-1657208670.0
So we're back to him and me from then on. I was talking to Nicole about this and I want to hear your views. Also, when you joined the band and you had in your case, it came with a lot of baggage, you replaced a member who had passed away. So were you facing a lot of comparison? Was there anything coming from the band side, from fans?
1657210290.0-1657221566.0
What were you hearing then? And it must put you in a very vulnerable place to have to replace a member like that. An iconic member. Yeah. Comparison to Win, et cetera.
1657221588.0-1657232740.0
Because washima YouTube, play tableau and sing at the same time. Right. I don't think there are many people who can do this.
1657275830.0-1657281140.0
Also. It couples with that kind of legacy. So that make you nervous often?
1657284650.0-1657314970.0
The band started practically the time you were born, right? It's almost as old as you, if not older. And legacy of a founding member. So Kabikawi Bot is cheese cup pressure I have to live up to what he did. Yeah bandmates and I used to be the butcher of the band.
1657342830.0-1657344410.0
Huge fan of your father.
1657348750.0-1657350090.0
You know my father?
1657376710.0-1657379220.0
An incident your surnames also.
1657384010.0-1657385910.0
That's quite the coincidence.
1657401470.0-1657403610.0
I was trying to get in touch with your father.
1657479270.0-1657498780.0
Comparison come confusion with Indian Ocean kari bharasal bharat bharasal. Right?
1657501870.0-1657522818.0
How has the band changed? How has the sound changed now? Nicholas mentioned that the band is launching an album this year. So you've been around long enough to see a sort of transition. The band has moved from its older hits to doing new music.
1657522904.0-1657533890.0
There have been new albums and films you've been part of. So experience rah or sound. Case. Indian Ocean.
1657563550.0-1657583090.0
You've been ocean all along? Primarily been a band that tools and I've known you've toured extensively and very often with them. What is life like as a touring musician? What are the good parts? What are the bad parts?
1657583510.0-1657585220.0
There are bad parts to win.
1657587430.0-1657625380.0
That is the ideal life chief by the time usually it is already twelve and you know you have to get. Up.
1657629750.0-1657706460.0
And go to the next city and repeat the same procedure again and I think you should be fine.
1657763870.0-1657829090.0
That's how you work, right? You make the most of the travel that is wonderful.
1657831530.0-1657863130.0
With such hectic touring schedules suddenly Pandemic there was an entire lull but even now bands are sort of staggering to get back to full calendars and all of that so what time Kesha Sahab I mean since you are dependent on touring what was the Pandemic like and what were you doing? I remember you started teaching again at that point also so tell me about the Pandemic. I know it's a difficult conversation.
1657867750.0-1657882020.0
Are a free time miller, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hot Star G five.
1658017910.0-1658042770.0
Concerts I know you've been touring you had to Bombay also quite recently so Pandemic to get back on stage it may Samay Bath how has it been and do you think performances are changing in any fundamentally way? Crowds come here, crowds are more careful. What is it like to play to a post Pandemic crowd.
1658058610.0-1658062880.0
Badly missing the audience and the energy I was talking. About.
1658067490.0-1658070370.0
Nothing else can give you that happiness.
1658142910.0-1658145340.0
That is good to hear.
1658148590.0-1658173010.0
You classically trained and I know you're still studying as well and you've played classical music as well. I want to understand what is your plan for the future? Is that something you continue doing on the side while you're with Indian Ocean? Do you stay connected to your classical routes?
1658180150.0-1658252300.0
Since I was in class continuously working primarily instrument of course exactly.
1658268870.0-1658281410.0
I'm really excited to know that you are launching a new album. Is there anything that you can tell us, anything that you can reveal?
1658311010.0-1658327602.0
Now we know what to expect. That's nice album Bohot Alagha from the earlier ones because it comes after a long break. Also YAFer, it is in sync with what Indian Ocean has been doing all this. Well. Yeah.
1658327656.0-1658345740.0
Again, the same answer with the whole thing.
1658349870.0-1658363920.0
Okay, that's really nice. We're looking forward to that doing. I'm just we are running out of time. So I just want to request you to take a few moments if possible to play something for us then we'd love to.
1658368610.0-1658381726.0
What do you lost? I know what it sounds like. I don't think that's going to okay. No problem, no problem. I'm sure we can do that separately.
1658381838.0-1658393554.0

It was great talking to you and hear your stories. Yeah, pleasure is all mine. I'm not very good at talking. No, I don't think that's the case. I think you had some really interesting and some very hilarious stories to share.

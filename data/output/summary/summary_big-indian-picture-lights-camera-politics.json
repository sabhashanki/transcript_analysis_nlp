{"summary": "JD and Lakshmi talk about their journey in the film industry so far. JD: I've been working in Tamil cinema since, I think for six years now. Lakshmi: I'm writing my own film and hoping to start making it sometime this Before coming to cinema, I mean, I came to cinema when I was 30. Now I'm 36. So before that, I had another lifetime of doing many other things. I was teaching for a year and I started You don't even remember how you look. You're just totally, completely gone You feel dead inside. It's not even dead on the outside It's nicer A good amount of time that goes into pre production, then it will show inevitably in your shoot, it will mess up. For my first film, which ran about 52 days of shoot, which was Virus, by the way, and it was huge camera.

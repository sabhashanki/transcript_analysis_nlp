And whenever you buy a Chinese product, you have a high probability that you're buying In the next four to five years we have to start making more and more semiconductors here. Dr. Ajaya Chaudhry is considered the father of hardware in India. He's also an advisor to India's semiconductor mission The first thing that this particular policy will do is to attract at least three to four silicon semiconductor plants to India. But in the meantime design cooper coffee emphasis is policymaker. At least 100 startups become fabulous Many sectors are strategic sectors and we need to worry about that.

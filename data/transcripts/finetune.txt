Welcome to Koiki Deha. It's been my longtime wish to have you here to start this with you with my absolute favorite. Thank you.
1657979290.0-1657981910.0
How do you feel? Thank you so much. It's my pleasure.
1657984090.0-1657986120.0
But how do you feel to be here?
1657990010.0-1658024482.0
I feel great. And I've always sorry I'm also eating while talking to you. But see, the thing is that when I saw you in OTT, obviously I didn't know you, and you came in as a warrior. You had a loud voice, and you kind of stood up for me all alone and made quite an impact on me and everybody outside. I think you didn't just speak for me, but you spoke for a lot of women like me who are marginalized or spoken of in a certain manner.
1658024546.0-1658042300.0
Just because I choose to be myself. And being myself may not be the best thing in the world, but please, I'm being myself. And so I've admired you since that day. I think you came like a so I'm happy to, first of all, be here on an app that you are developing and you're working on. And I'm always here to support you and love you.
1658043070.0-1658071060.0
Thank you. Thank you so much. But if we go back to 20 years, I know I'm taking you way back in the history, but you came and I think five of you, just mesmerized, the whole country. I mean, I think for all of us who have grown up on a lot of film music or even pop music, we we never had anything to call off our own. You know, this is 2000.
1658072070.0-1658100542.0
I mean, I remember when we were came and especially for it to be an all girls band. It was revolutionary in every which way. The songs you created, how five of you were so different from each other. And again, it was also one of the first reality shows. I mean, we're actually seeing these five aspiring artists being thrown together and finding their way and then creating those beautiful albums that you did.
1658100676.0-1658116340.0
So could you take me back to those days? NIH, was it always that you always wanted to be a pop star? I know you also said that you manifested we were in your life. But talk to me about those. How was it to be to be the Viva girl?
1658117910.0-1658156340.0
Especially the first process of the selection and the forming of the band? I still look at it as one of the most magical era or period of my life because it's very rare that you actually want something in life when it happens for you. I would set aside because this is not an emotional conversation we're having. I'm saying I'll set aside the good, bad and the uglies that happen along the way later, but that doesn't matter. But the first initial kickstart of Viva, the auditions, it was, for me, literally like I was dreaming with my eyes open and I was seeing the ten years of dreaming and the manifesting that I had done was unfolding before my eyes.
1658156950.0-1658194246.0
First of all, I feel Viva in itself. I think it was a cult and it was shattering a lot of myths of singers in the country or what was to come. Unfortunately, in Bollywood or in whatever, in Indian music, it couldn't follow through for too long. But like you Write Me said, when I was growing up in the, really looked up to, like, all the pop stars of India, and it gave me, like, a glimpse into what could happen for me once I became a pop star because I didn't want to be a playback singer. A lot of people find it very difficult to fathom this concept, but I actually didn't understand what is playback singing or I didn't want to be a playback singer.
1658194278.0-1658241802.0
I always saw myself as a frontliner, as a star, as somebody who was going to be rocking this world with fashion and singing and music and dancing and be like a pool all rounder, like a 360, you know? Because I grew up to Michael Jackson and, you know, Madonna and all rock stars and pop stars of the so Viva was like the first kind of glimpse into this could happen in India itself. And like, you and I, a lot of women who were from the spectrum of ten to twelve years younger than us and our age, because we were also like teenagers at that point for them, because it was the start. Like, how today influences have become that for people, right? Like, oh, I can grow up and be an influencer and make money through Instagram, whatever.
1658241936.0-1658264638.0
So Viva, I think it was also a dream that was being sold to a lot of people, like, and we were kind of the, you know, fire starters of that. And imagine overnight I had to literally pack my bags. Like, I still remember this day very clearly. Shubham Admiral comes to my house and tells me, hey, listen, you, you're selected. And I had 24 hours, literally 24 hours from that moment to pack my bags.
1658264654.0-1658275366.0
And my life changed after that. I flew to Bombay, I think, the day after morning. That and that's it. And then we were just and I never looked back after that. Of course.
1658275388.0-1658303946.0
We were like meeting from Javid to Chunka san loyal. So it was difficult. That part was also difficult. But the first album was also beautifully written, produced by some of the best in the country, from Saleem Saliman to Shankaras Hanloy to Rajya Singh to Shantana Mohitra and Sandeep Chatta Ashudu, I mean, you name it. And they were manish.
1658303978.0-1658321750.0
Mauriza was styling us. So, yeah, of course the dreams come true, right? But like you said about the algorithm, the songs are ever green. And I keep listening to it and I'm so in all of the production value. I mean, Neha, even you would agree.
1658321820.0-1658363826.0
So many of the songs which have come out maybe even this year or last year, would have actually not have the kind of production, the kind of writing and the overall performance that the Viva album had. Those songs are like I don't know with what intention you guys were creating it, but you just created history. Because even today, 20 years later, we go back to YouTube and we play those songs and act like full I mean, it's a full house. I mean, all of us can actually sit together. And I also feel about Viva is that it's as much for the crowd as it's personal.
1658364008.0-1658395822.0
I mean, I can put my headphones and I can listen to a song and just feel very connected to and inspired by or I can actually have my Girl gang or like six people in a party and it is still played and it's a banger. And I think that's also how you five connected felt for us. It's like we all had our favorites. We all had our favorite voices. And somehow, as young girls, I can definitely speak for myself and a lot of girls that I knew at that time, he just felt represented by all of you.
1658395956.0-1658417934.0
Like we said, Nihi is my voice, or understand, she's my kind of girl. I would love to be like her. I would love to look like her. And I also want to be in front not just someone's voice at the back. And in that case, in context, my favorite song is Doggozer.
1658417982.0-1658445290.0
I've also spoken to you about it in the past. It is, I think, one of the first, one of the most inspiring and feminist songs ever written in India. The way it connects to you as someone who's always striving for equality and he was just asking the world like, this is my time and I will not listen. I mean, there's a line also that purani savariti.
1658447890.0-1658473826.0
That's the line, and it's also your spirit, right? All the stereotypes and all the orthodox notions have never been able to defeat you, and you've always come out as a winner. Could you talk to me about Jaguar? I mean, how was it to actually created and to sing that fantastic song? Su Saleman Suleiman were the youngest, I think, on the list of the musical directors.
1658473858.0-1658502202.0
So, first of all, since we were really young and we were roaming around with all these stalwarts who were really scary, it was a refreshing change to meet Saleem Suleiman. I mean, half of us, not me, because I always looked up, had a crash on them. So we were all very excited to meet these two tall, handsome men. They had long hair at that time, and they had this whole Arabic rockstar kind of a look happening. And they had a very trippy kind of a studio.
1658502346.0-1658522898.0
It looked like you were in space, like it had a lot of things happening. So we were all very excited. We heard the song and we all knew instantly it's going to be definitely one of our favorite songs, the album, because it had a very world music appeal to it. It was very the kind of music that a lot of us grew up on. It was very non filming in its approach.
1658523074.0-1658571030.0
So I remember when we went to sing it, I was the first one who went inside the studio to sing, and by mistake, I think, which was a very rare thing, right? Because we all knew and we were like, wow, everybody loved it. And then Javita came and said and I was like, there was my one take moment and I had to redo my line. But anyway, Clinton Bethe was recording. My clinton was doing the Voice production on an album.
1658571370.0-1658587994.0
And that's why all the harmony sounds so beautiful on the album. A lot of people don't know that. So before the Satya, all that happened on Mr. Raman's album, he was already rocking our album, actually, Clinton. And he was the king of harmonies at that point.
1658588032.0-1658588940.0
Still is.
1658596050.0-1658625186.0
I was just sitting and singing because I used to sing a lot of RnB and hip hop at that time. I was very influenced by the mariahs of the world and the kind of music that Ariana is doing today, but more in the pop zone, right? So he sounds really good. I want you to go inside and do it. So it was only in their recording where we felt very free to just explore ourselves, to be ourselves, to laugh, to be a little goofy.
1658625298.0-1658648110.0
So I think Jaguar sana Ghana so important. Hey. But I also remember it as one of my favorite recordings on the album, wherein I didn't feel intimidated and I could actually explore myself as an artist in the studio. And of course, I still love Saleem and Suleiman. I feel like they were one of the few initial mentors who gave me the opportunity to also sing my first big film song.
1658651330.0-1658669300.0
But I'm shy in these things. I don't just call up people, randomly message them. And where my work is concerned, I'm a little bit of a stickler there. Boldly bathroom. But in my heart, I always regard them and love them a lot, right?
1658669690.0-1658713220.0
It is such a revelation for all of us also, that how in an industry which is so hierarchical, here, all five of you were creating something with the biggest followers and how they were so open and such a liberating atmosphere that they were so open to the way you wanted to see. So your expression and I mean, I'm sure when you are starting out in an industry, when you're given that freedom and you're also told that you're good the way you are, that is a lot of confidence for a new market. Well, all of them are not like that. Exactly. That's what.
1658715510.0-1658719220.0
All of them are not like. That, just to be honest.
1658722170.0-1658731720.0
For a 19 year old girl giving voice to something written by Javed Bakhtar, how Surreyal did it make you feel at that time?
1658733870.0-1658752800.0
It was also intimidating and also obviously he's one of the best writers in our country and also not just for the film music that he's writing, but he's also very well read and he's a master of his own craft to be in his company.
1658766230.0-1658777480.0
How do you take out that sound from the edge of your epiglottis and stuff? So we learned all of that because a lot of us, anushka Maho and I used to sing more in English at that point, right.
1658786750.0-1658806180.0
I was not like really what you're hearing today, which was looked down upon, by the way, today Nikita Gandhi is doing it and everyone loves it, believe me. She came in 2002. She would have been slandered like us. So that happens.
1658810470.0-1658873494.0
Which is great because like I said in the starting of the career criticism, when you say you're so well put together, but it's my grooming, honestly, I started like that and I also feel okay, it was tough on us and some of it wasn't nice. But I'm so happy that at least my initial days were to be groomed like a real star and not just want to be right. And also with you and with Viva, I think for the audience also, it opened up a new space, right? Like I said, it was so heavy on film music and we admired, of course, a lot of pop stars. But I think what roly pop music is and what is home grown pop music, I think it was really main streamed with we were because we were just became this representation for all of us, for all the college goers, for the youth and we started finding ourselves in it.
1658873612.0-1658922902.0
And so many of us who are music admirers also got to experience the technical brilliance of it which mostly we don't get to see because we don't celebrate our independent artists that much as we should. And I think I'll also talk about it later. But as we start moving on from Viva to your career ahead, when you look back at it at 2002 and those foundational days of your career, how does it make you feel now? I know the journey wasn't easy. Perhaps maybe right now you are not in the mood to kind of dwell on it.
1658922956.0-1658956400.0
But I know you've had your wholesome journey. Even at the age of 19, you experienced everything that was out there and for a Delhi girl to be here in Bombay and then we put through those scrutiny that you went through not just for your voice, but also for the way you look for watching more, it wasn't easy. But how does Nihabi today look back at that which by the way, today is considered as a revolutionary phase for Indian music. Really? Is it?
1658957270.0-1658984860.0
It is. I mean, when did we have again, you know, five girls walking? Yeah, I thought today is called I said today is not revolutionary at all. We're living, no? Yeah, see, you know, I'm in a very happy state today, but it's taken me a really long time to get here and at least I'm happy I arrived to wherever I am at today in my head.
1658985310.0-1659001598.0
Sometimes it's not just your outer reflection which reflects your inner self, actually, it's the other way around. It's how you feel about yourself and your life from within is what reflects on the outside. So it can never be out in. It has to be into out. It wasn't easy.
1659001684.0-1659027206.0
See, again, I would love and respect it, but would it really mean anything beyond a certain point? No, because I didn't live their life. Didn't live mine. Right. So I think you are a witness to your own life the most and you can have the maximum say on how you feel about it.
1659027388.0-1659050186.0
But number one, it wasn't easy because what I was setting out to do was something that didn't even have a precedence in India. Right. Like, imagine YVA Tuta charge on the brink of 21 and the band is broken. I can't go back home because I left my education midway and I don't want to study. I want to be a musician.
1659050298.0-1659057202.0
But Bollywood Ghana claim. Am I even good enough yet? I don't know. Do I even want to do it? I don't know.
1659057256.0-1659087370.0
Pop industry was at the brink of its kind of breaking, like in the sense katamorizi pop industry, bollywood was taking mainstream and stuff. So album Soni Repair, early 2000s my chicken artist never made it big. I don't want to name them, but most of them have had a parallel career in film music and hence their singles also doing well. Singles are familiar. Album Koi Asani is a standalone child rathapnah till YouTube started happening in 2010.
1659087440.0-1659106210.0
So you can understand that in the past seven, eight years of mine went in the limbo of trying to make things happen for myself and doing it all alone. My family didn't live with me in Bombay, they lived in Delhi. I was also very ziddy. My dad had a very good career in Delhi.
1659108230.0-1659142710.0
From navigating your way through obviously bad an industry which is full of a lot of things which aren't great, to not having anybody that I knew or could talk to or understand from them also very protective of myself since I'm a woman, right? And attractive woman who is also very open with me. Open nay them in a sense, it's like I would be open with my friends and talk my mind, but I didn't feel comfortable doing that with them publicly. Right. So I was still discovering my personality, obviously a series of bad boyfriends.
1659142790.0-1659166980.0
So I think that was the toughest phase of my life, in fact. 2004 to 2010, it was a very heady blur of feeling very low on my self esteem. Feeling very, you know, how do I pick up the pieces? Can't make her easy. I was making money, I was doing everything, but I wasn't getting that.
1659167750.0-1659176150.0
What do I want as an artist? Muji Kakarana. What is my voice? So one struggle was, this is not good enough. There needs to be more than this.
1659176220.0-1659185798.0
I need to sing something that means something. Secondly mujah hair. Mother this. And I wanted to be famous since I was a child, but for my craft, okay. I mean, I wasn't ever going to be an average Joe.
1659185814.0-1659200314.0
I was never going to be somebody would be okay with just okay. Success. No, I'm not born that way. I think till the day I die, I'm not going to stop. So that's just who I am in her dialogue.
1659200442.0-1659216660.0
Living alone for hours, being with myself, coming from a family where I was always surrounded by my family, there were some of the loneliest years of my life. Loneliest. There were days when I didn't have work for months, even after Kuchka happened.
1659219430.0-1659231018.0
Any military it's like Vishal Jaguar messaging me on Facebook, really good. We love you. We want to work with you. But still, nothing was really working out. It's like I was making a mark and yet not making a mark when you're somewhere in between.
1659231184.0-1659237260.0
So this phase was I think if I look back, it's the darkest phase of maybe seven or eight years of my life.
1659239390.0-1659266562.0
You also feel first, because perhaps industry has its own very rigid ways of looking at artists. They stereotype you so easily, but also because you were also quite not sure which path you actually wanted to take, right? Because you wanted to be a pop star. Always more than being a playback singer, I was sure. But there was an avenue for it.
1659266616.0-1659307226.0
When I went and spoke to the labels, at that point, they was making albums anymore. I was trained and groomed to write my own stuff or to co write with people, but nobody was wanted to do that anymore. The problem was that and I didn't have enough money to start releasing my own music, which is what I started doing after 2013. So the problem was not that I didn't know what I want, but then I had to start training myself, start learning Indian music, and start singing Bollywood. And I wanted people to say, like, I remember when Saleem told me on a flight, like we were going for a show, and he's like, because it's important in India to survive, shekhar will speak about Sunidhi.
1659307258.0-1659358106.0
And by the way, I'm a big Suniti fan, so please, audience, don't take this in the wrong way, that she is great, which is Indian music, which is why the folk, which is why I changed my direction. Like, what I'm saying is, what I was already trained for didn't have the avenue in India wasn't respected here. So a lot of my years went in retraining regrooming because Niha is one of the best yellow muji awards. It's not ego, it's just like I wanted to be their favorite as well. I wanted to have same chip on my shoulder that a sunidi had of being loved as an artist, of being loved as a vocalist.
1659358218.0-1659367460.0
And today everybody says NIH is a good vocalist. So I had to work on that. But my heart is still in independent music. What I'm trying to tell you is mira bilhama Kutki music.
1659370870.0-1659435802.0
But you know, NIH see travel across like a few years from 2002 and we come to the face where Niha Bhatti's voice was just now really gaining that kind of buzz. And people were like, when Kuchkas, I remember happening was age, I think it just became like with Pyanka Chopra's visuals in fashion was like you the voice was Niha. But I still feel that what 2011 finally did for you in terms of Bollywood music with bouquet, it's like, it's unmatchable. I mean, there you have one of if I talk about the visual first, you have one of the biggest superstars of the country just dancing her way out in a crowd with a voice that's so powerful, so grungy. And I mean, even today if you talk to people and when they listen to it, it's like you're transported to another world.
1659435936.0-1659464078.0
It's actually the kind of song which girls feel so passionately about. I think we all had our dunky moment in bathroom or in front of our mirrors, holding that mic and trying to really imitate you. Because I really, truly believe that the power in your voice is like it touches Denise. It's something which it's very rare to find in somebody's voice. And I also feel that it comes from your spirit.
1659464174.0-1659479590.0
And dunky is really which embodies the spirit of Nina Basin, the artist and the person who's just fearless and who will do things on her own and celebrate herself. So talk to me about Donkey. What was the experience like? Of course. Collaborating again with Saleem Suleiman?
1659482810.0-1659485640.0
Sorry, that's so he was saying, sorry.
1659492290.0-1659510690.0
Just worked on my album taba at that time. And that was another experience where everybody thought I'd lost my mind, whatever, all that shit was going on. Knowing me and you know me, I just walk in my own bubble, my own cloud, thinking magic.
1659513190.0-1659528386.0
Anyway, so Aliyaba suffered. I mean, I've spoken about this a lot of time. We go back a long way. We weren't really friends when we came in the industry, but I met him for the first time in college. We had all gone to bits.
1659528418.0-1659542794.0
Pilani, the festival there. And he was in Hindu college, I think. No, not Hindu. He was in Krodimal and we were I was in LSR. And I think there is actually a scene which I got to know much later which he told me about.
1659542912.0-1659562338.0
There's a scene and actually mehrabadaki Mulan, wherein they he has shown that Kivobaskarabujatiya Lad Koki college key. And then they come and they hitchhike with the women. And that actually happened. And that's when Imran Khan and Katrina meet for the first time. So this had actually happened.
1659562424.0-1659592054.0
And I think somewhere and I think his whole character was built somewhere on the base of his experiences. So when he called me, he had heard my album thaba on one of the outings and whatever, and then we lost touch because of that, and he was just an ad of another film. So one day he just randomly called me and said, hey, listen, I have a song, and I think you would be great for it. And I said, Great. I mean, I got to go to Yashiraj, but I had recorded before in Yashiraj because I sung for a Saleem Sullivan film.
1659592182.0-1659619766.0
But being called It wiref is always one pivotal moment, for the recording is one of the best studios, state of the art. When I went till I heard the song and I knew, like, when I Ghana Sunki Padaw, I'm going to really kill this song because it's up. When I heard Jaggumia, I almost shat my parents because I was like, this song, I can't sing it. It's too difficult. But when I heard Dunky, I was like, yeah, this bitch is up my ass, sort of a thing.
1659619788.0-1659643062.0
I'm going to really kill it, because at that time, I sing more pop rock. RNBag people who knew me 20 years ago or ten years ago, they won't believe what music I'm singing today. It's completely different. So anyway, I went in and we sang the song and we just nailed it. And it was also madachagya.
1659643206.0-1659662770.0
Katrina, I think, is also the best. She's looked I mean, she always looks great, but it's one of the best she's ever looked on it. And it was just a big fan of Ashattamil. I felt like it kind of embodied who I am as a person or my spirit, because spirituality behave.
1659678730.0-1659706770.0
I've always told you that I'm on a discovery of self. Like, in this journey, I'm here for myself and everybody else. I'm discovering them along the way. So Dunky is that, I think, discovery of self sort of a song. I also want to say I've been very lucky to get a lot of songs in which I really resonate with the lyrics that I'm singing, because I will not be very comfortable.
1659707590.0-1659710180.0
See, I have a very goofy side. To me, but more music.
1659712870.0-1659719190.0
I'm more of a babaji. It's important for me to sing stuff that resonate with my soul.
1659721450.0-1659724390.0
I don't know. I can't do frivolous stuff. Mr. Nyuta.
1659728330.0-1659780040.0
Like you said, I also observe this, that the songs that you've sung, the lyrics, have almost always kind of gone with the spirit of who you really are. And I think bulky is one of songs up there. And I think Gunky also became this voice of kind of a rebellion also for so many of us growing up. I remember I think I was in college, just to play that on a loudspeaker and just to just groove on it and you automatically feel that power. And of course, with your vocals in it, it always felt like it became an expression of the rebellion, especially for people like us who were always like so hungry to just get out and do our own thing.
1659780890.0-1659785340.0
And like I said, how you also described so beautiful is that it's also a celebration of yourself.
1659787390.0-1659797920.0
And here also in the audience, like somebody wants to just want vijay is just saying that. Could you maybe come a line or two, perhaps from Dunkis, if that's possible?
1659817290.0-1659835430.0
Kear stukhala gerard Lagalage.
1659849890.0-1659881820.0
I just had goosebumps. That's how I feel. I think all of us feel while listening to you. And it's such an honor, Niha, and such a privilege to really listen to you live and moving forward. Of course, you were doing these kick as independent songs albums and now you finally, I think you were also in that balance phase where you were doing both and you were like maybe also tasting the good of both the world.
1659885710.0-1659921734.0
In the folk space, you're saying? Yeah, after Dunky and the songs that followed instance, now you were like this established voice of people who are, I think I would assume the people who really wanted to work with you after that. And you were also kind of had your fine, you found your space with independent music. So how about the years after this, after this huge chart buster? See, every song that I have sung, I mean, and I also feel very privileged and happy about it now.
1659921772.0-1659991420.0
And whether that is in Bollywood or in Telugu or in Tamil, each song has been very critically acclaimed, has had accolades, nominations. And why I'm not saying awards mean the world to me, but why they mean something to me is because Godfather, which doesn't hold true anymore, unfortunately, because we live in this fake news at least ten years, they are not item songs. They're not songs where women were dancing and they were playing in the clubs. None of these songs are club thumpers, which is really weird because I always wanted to be a performer performer. But all these songs, they come from within sort of a thing.
1659992590.0-1660007890.0
Again, I'm saying for some reason I wasn't being flooded with playback work like Horatha. But Kiataki used to always say, we really want to work with you, but I want to work with you on that song, that song, that song, that song.
1660011830.0-1660032306.0
And not just here. I've heard that same dialogue in the south as well. Because the song I'm performing with you, one are actually songs that I sang in 2007. And Eight Ball was like kind of people still. Say it's one of his best songs.
1660032338.0-1660033750.0
Yuvan's. Best songs.
1660038890.0-1660068610.0
Going to get very angry when I make this statement. But I wasn't flooded. Let me be honest with you. But I had work. I always had work, but I wasn't flooded.
1660069050.0-1660074790.0
I sometimes feel very jealous. Now, Adigi fans will get very angry, but Adigit gets to sing the same songs.
1660084570.0-1660096746.0
All the songs are different from each other. Just because I can do it, I'm made to do it. Sort of a thing like the versatility. So we've was sitting and Samir was like, hey, listen, tirakama Ghana. Ghana.
1660096778.0-1660107438.0
Then you just sing. Now you have a YouTube channel, why don't you just sing something? And I said, what do I sing? I don't want to write my own music because I don't want to just sing for one, like, views or two live views and waste my own songs. So what do I sing?
1660107604.0-1660119890.0
I don't want to do 90s coverions, which everybody was doing at that time. So Sam was like, Why don't you sing folk? And again, I've spoken about this in the past, but I was like, Are you mad? I don't sing folk music, dude. That's not my zone.
1660120390.0-1660135514.0
We just picked up the guitar and we said, sing any song that you know, obviously being a Punjabi Lattidi. So I started singing latitude. Samir is a magician, literally on the guitar. So he started playing and I was like, Fuck, this sounds really nice. This sounds so good.
1660135552.0-1660161266.0
And we recorded and then we just shot it ourselves. And of course, properly, like on a 5D, Sam got a fly boy. I did my own makeup, everything. This is the first time we are doing everything on our own, okay? I mean, now we just put the video up there and we suddenly saw people like this.
1660161368.0-1660176550.0
And we didn't promote it, nothing. Then we did baji DA sita. And of course, again, there was no compulsion that I need to do something. If you see even my folk music, I've not done it in a very mainstream manner. I was again groomed as a college student to sing unplugged music.
1660176620.0-1660189900.0
Like, we used to sing with a piano or just a guitar. This is actually my grooming as a vocalist to sing with minimalistic music, right? So I think I was just finally getting a chance to do that.
1660192670.0-1660219794.0
It's like my DNA is Punjabi and a lot of people felt that I kind of sounded very natural singing this music. And then we did Akashni, and then the next song, industry was looking, industry was listening and they started feeling. And that's how Jaggunya happened. I know I'm jumping stories, but I'm just giving it to you as it really was that everybody watches everything. You know, that right.
1660219832.0-1660245962.0
In the industry, everyone watches everything, but they all just sit back and don't say anything. And that's when Vishal Shaker called us and said that, hey, listen, I love your pope music. And I've Juggun Yaka female version, kursatokya with exactly the way you do your Pope music. And there you go. That's how I got the visiting card into this sound that today I feel is synonymous to me or to Samir.
1660246106.0-1660282890.0
And where it's earthy, yet it's Western, yet it's, I think, the perfect blend that maybe I was waiting for. I really give Samir the credit for that for sure. But with Naijana, how did you guys come up with that video? That's something I was like, I still watch that video neha on loop. Because with those lyrics, with that audio and that visual, I think it's one of the most fantastically created songs and in totality with visuals and with audio.
1660284030.0-1660313794.0
See, when all my videos, folk music specially, we've always not deliberately but I think that's, again, a personality thing that when I even work with a video director, they don't come up with anything, which is normal. I don't know why, like Muji Bhikpi may be excited to jatiya. So when he came to me prayer with who I've worked a lot. Now a lot of my big videos are done with him. Parva also being one of them that he said that I want to.
1660313832.0-1660354346.0
Basically, when he drew out the picture board, he told me that you'll be a singer in a cabaret bar or a dancer or whatever, and you are working in a bar where you love this boy. And there is this Khadooz manager that basically is like after you and he keeps coming and knocking at your door and telling you when you say Mujinijana marriage, how today people would see it. See, I didn't think it's going to become an anthem at weddings. Right? And again, no, I mean, people were dancing to Tamata songs at that point at weddings.
1660354538.0-1660363854.0
Matamata or Nabhaji. Who? Or Meghan. Whatever. So I didn't know that this kind of aesthetic music is going to really folk music was not playing at weddings.
1660363902.0-1660375960.0
It's a fact. And as much as the industry or people wouldn't want to credit me for it, I really kick started that. For people to actually have good taste at weddings and listen to yeah, people, I am cocky. Okay, I will take the credit. Okay.
1660377290.0-1660398606.0
Yeah. Kiss me. Kiss me. Okay. The point is that's how it happened and I didn't know it's going to become so you'll do it the way you want to do it.
1660398628.0-1660412190.0
Now. I'm not answerable to anybody, right? So we specially got that costume made. Like, I was very inspired by Burlesque at that point. So I wanted the very old classic Hollywood kind of hair.
1660412350.0-1660433546.0
And so I'm enjoying myself. A lot of times people, maybe now they understand me better. I am on a journey of self pleasure as an artist. I want to enjoy my life. I want to wear what I want.
1660433568.0-1660434940.0
I want to sing what I want.
1660442350.0-1660463986.0
najana is one of my favorite bidders as well. And we sought it in an office space of a friend wherein we converted his whole office into a set because we didn't have in our budget at that point. There's also a lot of creativity that went in. That how we created that set and painted it. Some of the furniture came from my house because my house was like a mini mulan rouge at that point.
1660464088.0-1660488714.0
I was single at that point, I had a bachelorette pad and my house was all pink and white. And she was very inspired by the decor in my house. So, I mean, it's definitely one of those videos what enjoy Kyamata, creating that space for ourselves. Wow. And I know this that you've also spoken about how this was something that your father always wanted you to do, right?
1660488912.0-1660524374.0
Just to be connected to your roots. And your mom is also so happy that you started doing so much of Punjabi folk. And of course, you have revived you and Sami together. Not just revived it, but just made it so mainstream. It's not just weddings, but now there are covers, even in Bollywood songs of the most beautiful folk that you have sung, whether it's Madhania, whether it's Akashni or of course, Chita Kukkar, and with those back to back beautiful and such innovative videos as well.
1660524412.0-1660570660.0
And I think that will definitely go into the archival history of Indian music when it comes to folk, when it comes to independent singles or albums. So can you talk to me also about Niha kind of feeling back, like, I think going back to your roots with this music? See, it has definitely connected me in the best possible way to, one, my Punjabi roots. Secondly, to me also being in Indian, I think somewhere down the line, because I grew up so much on Western sensibilities, of course, musically, fashion wise, many sensibilities aesthetics, both global, both Indian. I'm okay with that.
1660571190.0-1660583500.0
I think somewhere Ghana, Sharu Kia, not talking about just the love coming from people, but the connectivity. For the first time I fell to Indian music was only through Punjabi music.
1660587470.0-1660607058.0
Sometimes even on my Instagram when I would just sit down and sing. I actually prefer doing the Punjabi stuff because the minute I sing that the Indian roots in me are happy. I feel very connected to it. Mom and dad obviously feel very happy. Mama, I think, feels happier because Mama has helped a lot with the folk music.
1660607224.0-1660623000.0
Even on the folk tales. A lot of Puraju repertoire have Mama, she'll sing 30, 40 songs and send me and sing, and a lot of them mama pioneered that in my life because she is the source of that music for me.
1660627450.0-1660630950.0
I have heard it from my own mother's mouth, from my nanny's mouth.
1660640190.0-1660644960.0
A lot of sometimes the folk songs that we sing, other versions that are sung in my house.
1660648370.0-1660661662.0
Wow. You can hear me, right? Yeah, I can hear you. Yeah. So I know that we don't have a lot of time, so of course I'll be very quick, but how can I not, of course, talk about Jaggumia?
1660661726.0-1660708900.0
And in the same breath, also about your back to back collaboration. Very weirdly on Salman Khan songs, whether it's Jaggumia and of course, your long standing collaboration with Aliya Bazafar or Rashni or Dilia Galla. I mean, three of the most celebrated love songs ever. When we talk about contemporary Hindi film music and Niha, what you did with Jaguar Mia, you know, I mean, I always start crying whenever I listen to your version because it's so full of love, longing and, you know, that desire to be with somebody whom we love. And your voice, I mean, I don't know, it's like I always call Nehabasin's voice as the voice of love.
1660710710.0-1660719240.0
Can you please tell me about it? Especially because that kind of version, nobody had heard the folk tune in it.
1660722650.0-1660751726.0
So, like I told you that it started with Vishal, made me hear the male version and said that we want you to produce this and sing it like how you do your folk stuff. So we say, okay, it was pretty much us. They gave us the liberty, first of all, which is great. They trusted Samir and me, and then we created it and we kept it very minimalistic. We kept it very early, to be honest.
1660751908.0-1660792490.0
And I always feel like feelings, this is where, thankfully, me being a barrage of feelings comes handy because humans are made of water, I'm made of feelings. So I'm at least able to put that back in my music, you know. And mujabi already jagunya ganatu bhagbadiya thai kavi bhartara vata it was not so difficult just to resonate with it and just sing it. And, you know, Samir is very good with string instruments and earthy instruments and Sam in general is a very big fan of folk music. Not just Indian, but world folk music.
1660792640.0-1660811394.0
Bomadlab greek folk music. Bison balkan bot suntai tuski bought fascination. So for him, this is a candy line. He's somebody who's very weird because he loves electronic music and he loves folk music. So they're two completely different spectrum of sounds, but he's very good at both of them.
1660811512.0-1660839978.0
And also, let me tell you, that why a lot of people resonate with my unplugged versions is that my voice is in a certain resonate. This is a bit technically, but it falls in a certain resonation of like a cello, you know, the instrument cello. So it's it's basically like a low, mid, deep voice. So a low, mid, deep voice will always do better with minimalistic music. Singers I'm forgetting how can I forget her name?
1660840064.0-1660865700.0
Kavita kavita sait kavita sait shilpa raw a lot of the Pakistani artists why Coke studio is such a big deal. Because Jabu Beach Electronic Studio Pakistan people are not liking it. But when it's minimalistic, you love it, you know, because their voices are again, deep. My roots are also Punjabi, right? So voices, minimalistic music.
1660867670.0-1660910640.0
So Sameer has kind of found that space. That's why whenever I work with him, I feel like I've really shown I remember Saliman saying, yes, Saleem Samira, we found the right space for you, like how to sit your voice in the right manner. So, yeah, I hope I get to do that with other people also, and. Not just with San, but Niha moving forward. And I think that would be also the last bit, because it's the current bit, but I find it very fascinating that you get these film fair awards and Nihaba scenes, voices, of course, everywhere, everybody.
1660911410.0-1660951706.0
It's like, I think every time A Salman comes and misannounce, we just look forward to that. They will be a Nihbasin song too. Or whenever Salman and Katrina will come together, Neha's voice will be the love anthem. But after all of that, Neha, you come on one of the biggest reality shows and there we are, we have the pop star, we have the rock staring of the scene and she goes through her completely mesmerizing and eventful journey on national television. And then she comes out and after what, like after six months, she writes this banger of a song called Parva.
1660951818.0-1660966260.0
And like all your music, it comes from such a personal space. And personally, I know how you actually wrote it, what went through your mind. But for the audience, perhaps, who might not have.
1660974970.0-1660976680.0
Can'T hear you. Wait. Hello?
1660998290.0-1661004798.0
Hello? Yeah, can you hear me? Sorry, Pranka. I lost you. Can you hear me now?
1661004964.0-1661009760.0
Yeah, I can hear you now. Sorry.
1661012630.0-1661022870.0
I want to ask you that what does perva really mean to you? And especially at this juncture of your career, of your life journey?
1661026730.0-1661047520.0
So, truth be told, as much as people who love me will obviously agree with me, and people who don't will not even agree with me if I actually turn God. So that's never going to change. But I genuinely feel I have been judged a lot by people.
1661063990.0-1661072418.0
Humans were born to ear. We're born to make errors. We're born to learn, live. We're not here for perfection. We're here to, like I said, discover oneself.
1661072434.0-1661094060.0
And you cannot discover unless you really live your life. And when you live your life, you'll experience everything. But somehow I've always felt very judged by people. And of course, my Big Boss journey was in my head. It was a beautiful journey, but a part of the world viewed it the way they wanted to view it.
1661094510.0-1661112914.0
So when I came out of Big Boss OTT, I was obviously sad. I was angry. It started with feeling like, what the hell? And then it went to a lot of anger. There's a lot that I wanted to say and I didn't want to just sit on Twitter and rant about it or sit on Instagram and talk about it.
1661112952.0-1661121750.0
Because as an artist, the whole point of being a songwriter or a writer or a singer is that you can actually tell your story through a song.
1661130410.0-1661135334.0
I can't remember his name. What's wrong with me? You know this name, right? Deep. Deep.
1661135382.0-1661137206.0
Deep. Deep. Deep. Deep. Deep.
1661137318.0-1661150810.0
Deep is going to kill me. Deep Kali. So Deep and I deep and I were introduced to each other through my then manager and very one. He's a young, talented, fantabulous guy. I'm really looking forward to seeing his career unfold.
1661150970.0-1661204990.0
So many Hindi mech likata because medi Punjabi writing. I've written a few songs, but sometimes I struggle with the vocabulary and stuff. So I wrote to him, like what I wanted to talk about. And then the next day he came up with Jay Karthi Parvati Lokaandhi and this is not just about big balls overwhelming, I'm not going to say. But if that starts affecting your craft, if that starts affecting your life or what your authenticity is as a person, then that's the end of you.
1661205140.0-1661224822.0
Then you are just as corrupt as everybody else. And I have a major problem with corruption of my soul. So I think somewhere this song represents that part of mejapaya. Angry, niyo up, gusaniyo you're just like, this is it, man, just take it or take it or just move on. Because I'm not going to change.
1661224876.0-1661227000.0
I will evolve, but I shall not change.
1661233310.0-1661247360.0
And naturally, my body, my mind, my soul doesn't gravitate towards behalf. It just doesn't. It's just not how I'm born. But the difference was earlier it used to make me very unhappy. A lot of people also said this.
1661258130.0-1661306400.0
I'm coming to that point where 90% have a nice ice cream or something and then just move on from it. So I'm learning that maybe a little late in the day because I used to genuinely prince think towards the light.
1661311590.0-1661331014.0
It's like when you're walking on the street. And Kapikabi, I always say this key when you're walking on the street, especially in India, I live on Carter Road, a beautiful street, but there is dog poop everywhere. Now, if I look down and walk, I'll only see poop. I look up and walk so I can see the sea. That's what I'm talking about.
1661331052.0-1661347440.0
You see what you want to see and rest you let it be. So Parvais, I think, a representation of that. And I'm very proud of that song. Very proud of that song. I personally feel it's one of the most representative song of how I feel about myself and life that I've ever done.
1661349410.0-1661399920.0
But lastly, this is out of curiosity. Throughout the session, I kept feeling this. That how you also spoke about constantly that when you've always been sure of your path, but the circumstances or the world around you took time to adjust to your desires, right? Like to really come together, to kind of aid you to do what you really wanted to do while you always knew what you really wanted to do. But tell me, Neha, from a very singer artist point of view, when somebody has this fantastic and magical voice that you've had and sung such amazing songs, when that person is told that we want to work with you or maybe on that song or this song, how do you process it?
1661400290.0-1661432890.0
What do you question about it? I mean, I sometimes feel why do certain fingers take time or why does world take time to kind of open to them when the world knows their talent and the limit of that talent, which is like limitless. So why do you feel that despite you being there and you being such a great artist that you are, that the industry, if I just specifically say Bollywood music took time to kind of really lap up your talent?
1661438990.0-1661464770.0
I actually don't have an answer for this. I think if I delve into my spiritual self, then I will say that maybe in this life I have come to do what really my creator wants me to do and not what the world wants me to do. And maybe the world didn't have what I was supposed to do, and hence I was supposed to find my own path. A lot of times I do feel that that is probably the truth of my life, and that may be the truth of a lot of good artists.
1661467670.0-1661497760.0
The only difference, I think okay, let me say, I think for me, the difference is more I wish I could have even today, have bigger platforms to reach out to a larger audience for what I love doing. Obviously, give you song for a big film, automatically your song is being served to millions of people versus when I do an independent song on my own label, then I have that slight limitation versus if I do it on a label, but then the label wants me to do the song I don't want to do.
1661502210.0-1661540162.0
I think what we want to hope for is that we align with more people who actually want to do what we also want to do. I would say today that is more my wish than really wanting to do a lot of work. I want to do a lot of work, but I don't want to do work I don't like. I want to do work that I resonate with, that I celebrate. I mean, there must be a reason why I've been nominated for film nine times, actually.
1661540316.0-1661562482.0
When I'm singing, my whole body, my mind, my soul is aligned in the process of what I'm doing. And unfortunately, that doesn't happen to me in every song. That only happens to me in songs that I actually resonate with. So I am hoping, let the creator, let the world, let the music directors listen to my soul and make more songs that resonate with my soul. So maybe that's my job in this life.
1661562616.0-1661612974.0
So I don't think that they don't recognize the talent. Maybe I'm not gravitating towards something that I don't like and unfortunately I could be wrong. But before we let you go, what do you would like to tell all the female artists, perhaps for whom you are an inspiration? Why I asked this especially I do feel that you're not only judged because you're a woman, a woman who not only has a voice, but also knows how to screen, shout, write and express her voice. But I also feel because you're also a musician, a female musician, you are judged more because musicians in general, India, have always been looked as people who should be in the background.
1661613022.0-1661624520.0
Right? Why do you have opinions? You're not an actor, you're not somebody who's in the front we are not interviewing you. But you have things, don't forget that. They feel why should I look fit?
1661625130.0-1661639674.0
Yeah. Why do I have a body? Why do I show it? Why do I wear certain kind of mujiko? Basically, I should hide somewhere behind a parada and I should just sing sorry, darling, it's not going to happen.
1661639712.0-1661670782.0
I'm here to shine as bright as change the hora, unfortunately, but change hora hope maybe the next generation will enjoy it more naturally. But buhab also people have seen Indian singers image. There is a very pious sort of an image and a woman's sensuality or sexuality takes center stage. It really unnerves them. They figure to actresses because it's in the script.
1661670846.0-1661690138.0
People forget in the script also, if they don't want to do it, they can say no. Nobody's putting a gun on their head and saying take your clothes off or wear a bikini and do a shot. I mean, it's something that they want to do. It's not like you're saying if I was an agent in a film and I didn't wear a bikini, it won't make my role any less. Right?
1661690304.0-1661710114.0
But they have now started still accepting it there. But the same thing when a single does they feel and also immediately start kind of putting you in putting you in a desperate zone or an attention seeking be salty. Attention seeking. I've been the same for 20 years. How much attention do I want?
1661710152.0-1661710740.0

How much attention do I really want? But I think most importantly, can they rendezanda? Can I go? I'm still going to do what I'm going to do. And hopefully like today I found a lot of people who actually resonate with me.

Let's just hope that that clan keeps growing and we can round out the voices of the people whose voices actually should have never been there. Only beautiful. That's such a kickass note to actually end this. But I really, really want to and if you can could use this thing one or two line of Pariva. Because I think that's also the spirit with which I would like to look at all of us in 2022.

Again, goosebumpy. And for everyone, I'm sure everyone here at present has already listened, watched million of times. Parva. But if you still haven't, you need to listen to this, and you need to watch Neha Pate and all her glory. I think this is neha Bazida is one of the artists I think we all can just keep listening to and watching the rest of our life and without ever feeling.

So thank you so much, Niha. It's been such a pleasure talking to you. I mean, of course, I say this every day to you on phone, but this time it was very special because there were people listening to us. And I wanted to start this, which has been very close to my heart with you, because I love you and thank you for all the music that you've made. And not just music, but you've given voice to a lot of us.

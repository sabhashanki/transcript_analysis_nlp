1653848250.0-1653878258.0
So we have a few viewers joining in and for them you have with us today Mr. Sandra Kaiti. He is the Executive Director of plant based Food Industry Association of India and they have recently organized the first plant based food Summit. And today we'll just talk about exactly that. We talk about how the Summit works, we talk about the takeaways of the Summit, what are the next steps for the industry and what your location can play a role in adoption of plant based approach in India.
1653878434.0-1653881240.0
So is your settlement jump into the question?
1653883770.0-1653896540.0
Yes, absolutely clear. So Sanjay, you want to start off by telling me a bit about how the Summit works for you and what kind of response you need from businesses and continue when you are now.
1653899970.0-1653943270.0
This response has been amazing. We have got an opportunity to interact with all the stakeholders in one place and this was unprecedented. This was for the first time in India, a plant based food submit was happening, although there have been similar attempts in Europe and Canada and US. But in India this was the first time. So we had a great opportunity to bring in all the food startups in this space in the plant based food sector.
1653943350.0-1653997900.0
And we also had a great opportunity to speak to the ingredient suppliers, also understand from various machinery suppliers, the NGOs working in this space and also those engineers working in the animals right moment. We also had an opportunity to speak to 100 scientists. So there were hundred scientists in this room and there were 100 food startup CEOs. And this kind of an interaction meant that they were talking about how to improve the quality, the product development, new products, and there were a few investors like Ahmed Savisi in the room who are totally focused on this factor. And we also had the government represented very well.
1653999250.0-1654052798.0
In fact, that was very heartening to see that from the government people from minister to joint security to undersecurity to invest india team and Aprida, which is explored authority for agriculture and also food safety and standards. Authority of india and the eat right movement, which is strategic by FSSAI and many other similar organizations, both from the government of PFI and CIA were represented too. So it was unprecedented. It sounds like an absolute success. My little time there was a very buzzing environment that I walked into.
1654052884.0-1654074840.0
There were like a lot of policies going on around planting food. Honestly, I have not seen before. Even I've been in touch with several startups planting food afterwards. But just on conversation that happened at the Summit, I have not seen yet. So I think that was an absolute success as far as the first Summit goes of this time.
1654075930.0-1654111250.0
And it was the first of its kind Summit in the food and beverage industry in India, right? Yes, this was the first of its kind and it culminated to the Summit. But there were a lot of other mini conferences and webinars and interactions which were going on. One of that was the government writing directly to the startups. This was unprecedented and we were very happy to see the government taking so much of interest in individually writing to each and every startup.
1654111990.0-1654147580.0
Our startups were so much happily and amazed that a person at the joint Secretary level individually writing to them, sort of assuring them of the support by the government and ensuring that the government is there with them and will continue to interact with them in the future. And how Ppfia has been representing these startups. For startups wondering what is happening? Is it a dream which was going on? It never happens and it is happening for us.
1654148450.0-1654193590.0
We looked at it more like a blessing by the Minister because once his support was there and Secretary Mrs. Anita Praveen support was there, the rest of the colleagues in the Minister were also very much enthusiastically supporting this Summit and the run up to the summit. For close to one month we were there in the ministry very, very regularly and interacting with various parts of the ministry. Explaining to them what this new sector is explaining to them that how we are expecting the support. From the investors, how this can help farmers to double their income.
1654193750.0-1654250318.0
How it can ensure that the international support from similar organizations can be there. So these were all things which were happening and simultaneously and I personally would like to believe that even Ministry's understanding of the government's understanding of this subject has also gone up in this. Just to give you an example, just after the summit we were invited by Abida to visit their headquarters and meet their official senior officials, including their secretary and also Mr. Viki who is the general manager whose team is writing the Vegan standards. So when we spent time over there and they hosted Rachel Dresskin, who is the CEO of Plant based Food Association in the US.
1654250404.0-1654311780.0
Who is my counterpart in the US we felt that there was so much of enthusiasm. And even the minister once again said when we met the delegation on 15th March and again when we met him at the summit, on both occasions he said that it is very important to engage with all the people. Find out a bigger room, he said find out a bigger room. That why we are not allowing everybody to come in because the room, although was very big he had 425 people attending it but it turns out that there were more than 2000 people who wanted to come and because of the size of the venue which we had booked it was virtually impossible to accommodate more than 425 people. And so the Minister said that now think of a bigger venue, maybe we would go to began one, probably can accommodate more.
1654312870.0-1654344840.0
Only thing is began one as a cater style of seating and we were looking for a venue which has more like a roundtable kind of seating so that there's a little bit of interaction while people are in the Summit. But now we have just got this over so we will find out how to plan for the second plant based Food Summit which will be next year, in 2020.
1654353650.0-1654406010.0
Several government officials are probably involved in the Summit. What do you think is the role of the government at the moment? Obviously, aiding summits like this is one, but what is like a bigger role of the government in aiding the market? First of all, I must say that government for the first time I think is running faster than the private sector as far as this particular runway sector is concerned, because the government has really supported us right from the day one, even before the whole thing started, the government stepped in. And not just the minister who supported us, but also the each and every part of the government, including the regulator, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.
1654406170.0-1654459374.0
We were very kindly received by the CEO of FSSAI, Arun Shingle at his office and we were also kindly received by his advisor, Mr. Paskaran, and also the Executive Director. He had a chance to meet her as well inoshisharma and then they represented her, Ms. Anushi Sharma, in A Shisharma, who is the Executive Director for Compliance. She came and she came with her team who were telling people about the eat Right movement and also that how the compliance is very important and how the what are the issues that as food startups can face run up to their expansion and how they should be preparing themselves.
1654459572.0-1654484790.0
So there was a very strong support from each and every part of the government. And government feels very happy that we are opening up a new market for the plant based food products, not just in India but abroad. That means a lot of people will get jobs. That means a lot of people will be able to get employed for exports. India will be able to step into those opportunities which were not available earlier.
1654485290.0-1654532642.0
And this whole sector is booming, not just India, but also in the other parts of the world. Do you feel there is a need for certain government PR campaigns for planting food in India just to make people aware that these products exist and these products are good for your health and these are the benefits of the product right now? Did you feel the government can do something to promote that from there? Well, government has with many arms. So when we say Government, you mean Ministry of Food Processing Industry, which is where the word food is very predominantly written, where the Minister of Food Processing Industries supports the development of the whole sector.
1654532786.0-1654596518.0
But you also have a part of the government which is APEDA, which is part of Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade. So APIDA is for the export and then you also have Fixed, which is the Skilled Council for the Food and which is in any way part of the Ministry of Skill Development. And then you have Ministry of Agriculture which Chili Thenji has as the Minister of Agriculture and with the National Horticulture Board and other bodies are there, the entire supply chain actually are in their control. And then you also have Food Safety and send us Authority of India which many people don't know actually falls into the Ministry of Health and Family Virtue. So then you have Ministry of Consumer and then you have Minister of Tribal Development, you have Minister of Agriculture, Administrative Rural Development and then you also administer and you have Minister of Cooperation which is a young new ministry which has come in directly, indirectly.
1654596614.0-1654623778.0
All these ministries, they work in tandem, they work together. We feel that the government is joined by so many other private sector enterprises which work with the government. For example, for the cooperative movement, there's National Cooperative Union of India or NCDC. National Corporate Government Corporation. So Indian government is vast and food is a state subject.
1654623954.0-1654689100.0
Is a state subject. So there are a lot of parts of the government which are working in close coordination with each other and there's a lot of wisdom in bringing up those institutions and it is up to Pbfia Plantbased Foods Industry Association to engage with each and every part of that. So that when we propose to the government that let's make a task force which is a Mofi APIDA, Fssci and PBFI task force so that there's a coordinated progress on that, coordinated development of that. And as you know that the consumer awareness in times like today when there is a Twitter and there is a WhatsApp and there is a LinkedIn and social media and Facebook and of course Instagram, so so many social media platforms from YouTube. So creating consumer awareness is not difficult.
1654691070.0-1654737798.0
Message goes viral in no time. So we are particularly so much concerned about the consumer awareness because we feel that there is demand and consumer is actually ready to pay for a premium for something which is a plant based food. So it is on us that we should provide those wholesale yummy plant based foods and government is ready to support us. The consumer is ready to rebuild the progress. There is a lot of money which is coming in and if at all that they are all waiting for is for the industry plan to become big enough and provide what we are promising.
1654737894.0-1654770740.0
So actually all the work is on my desk and on the desk of the plant based food companies and we have regarded lot more than what we could have asked for. The media platforms like Kulkay which are growing by leaps and bombs by every day you give us a platform also impacting the consumer demand. So I just thank you very much for this.
1654772870.0-1654801580.0
Lovely to have you here and the politics that are on plant based food is growing every daily. Added speaker from the industry as well and the response is really nice. People want to know more about this. People want to know more about the benefits as you can access it and how does it help the environment as well. It brings me to my next question how does the association Pbfia exactly help the market and adoption of plant based food?
1654802050.0-1654804800.0
What exactly does the role that play?
1654807570.0-1654831506.0
I would say Pbfia is like the family elder so it's still part of the family. It's not something outside of family. So it is a representative of all the food startups, the plantbased food startups. So we engage with them on a real time basis. We are not like a trade union which is saying hamari Mangay, purika purika.
1654831538.0-1654867090.0
It's not set up but it's an association. So it works more with the own members and less asking others to give us something because we are not really asking. We know that there's a lot of things that we have to learn to climb the high bar which has been set by Food Safety and Centers and authority of India and we are not complaining for that, that you have set a high bar. We are not happy because it is in the interests of consumers. But we are also a little bit scared.
1654867590.0-1654898582.0
Why? We are scared because that high bar, big multinational companies and big food FMCG companies can easily cross that. But our food startups, they are young boys and girls. They do not know what is hesitant, they do not know what is the food quality standards that they have to reduce their salt here and the food cannot be overprocessed. It should be not just tasty but also hygienic and safe.
1654898726.0-1654957294.0
So all are basically giving us a little bit of challenge that we have to learn. We have to get the knowledge and understand the standard which has been prepared waiting for the government, not is also writing the standards for exports. So we have to be ready to fulfill everything in the standard. So the compliance is perfect. Although Minister said that we have to make sure that the compliance is there so that we don't make I believe he must have implied I don't want to put words in his mouth but the message is I inferred from his speech when he said compliance must be there.
1654957412.0-1654987610.0
So I think what he was saying that you must make sure you come out with a standard which everybody can comply. Not a standard for starters fail. But I'm going one step further. I'm saying good that you have come out with the standard which is difficult to comply. Now help the startup so that they are able to comply and you give them you give them know how we incubate them together.
1654987760.0-1654993660.0
So we are in conversation with FSSA on that because FSSA is with the standard.
1654995870.0-1655019940.0
And we tell them that it is your responsibility to make sure that we don't. So for us to pass, you have to work with not just make the standard and then forget about it. Then a lot of our startups will not be able to climb it. And then they will be telling what is the standard year? Because people want to take success.
1655020550.0-1655041850.0
They don't want to see if they have enthusiasts. It is a responsibility of the genders to make sure that they succeed. So we have to work with them. We have to guide them, we have to schedule them. We have to maybe spoil them sometime, the standards, but we make sure that they pass the standard.
1655041920.0-1655062270.0
At least 90% of the people must pass. Everybody should not fit. Will you see compliance coming up from the plant based? Yes, the plant based foods have another word which is very similar to that, and that's called vegan.
1655064290.0-1655089770.0
Vegan standard had been made. A VMARK has been made. A lot of work has been put in by Food Safety Authority of India. And I congratulated them I commend them but it's not converted into a law because the government has to ratify the notification and they have to say that just now, from today or from tomorrow, it's a law. So it can convert into a law anytime.
1655090190.0-1655109662.0
I was actually thinking that at our submit, the government will make this announcement and it will turn into a law. So it didn't happen that day. So that means it can happen maybe in the next month or maybe next year. We do not know when it is for the government to decide. So the standard is developed and FSS is done.
1655109796.0-1655125080.0
It scanned. Now it's waiting to be implemented and converted into law. So once that happens, we have to get our people that if you want to use the VMARK, then you have to do this.
1655127850.0-1655144940.0
What will happen is one of them will fail the VMARK. Will they say, okay, we'll write the plant based because there is no standard for plant based. Plant based is everything Dal routine also plant based. Everything plant based. Right.
1655145790.0-1655170978.0
Good cream of that. So then Dal is a plant based Dal. If you want to buckle Dal, we have, you know, butter bean coming from the plant based. Also margin was always there. So once the people start writing plant based and because they're failing the VMARK, then we need to work with the government.
1655171144.0-1655218626.0
That is the VMARK becoming only from the bigger one and the successful ones and the plant based world going to be used by the rest of the masses. So are we trying to make VMARK as like a city standard or is it I'm just overthinking and nothing of that is going to happen and the government is going to actually make sure that everybody passes. So these are the questions come into my mind. I'm not posing the government because I myself believe that we should talk to each other more before we form our opinion. Because there is no hurry, it has not converted into a law.
1655218728.0-1655253098.0
So we should see how it happens. And once we see we should help the companies to fulfill this. Once we see that yes, this is happening, then there will not be any need to form any opinion on that part. And I'm very optimist that everybody will be able to use it. PDFI is also the person for the startups and companies that the government to have the market grow and have the startup meet compliance standards.
1655253194.0-1655278594.0
If I'm understanding it right, yes. So Pvfi will work with the comment and also with the startups. It will work more with the startups to ensure that we follow all the things which are there in the standard. Not just in letter, but also in the spirit. I mean, one question that comes to my mind when I talk about the growth of plant based food in India is that currency.
1655278642.0-1655310186.0
If I'm not wrong, there's an 18% tax on the package, plant based products that you see online or in the market. So that 18% tax. I think that there's an opportunity for it to reduce, make it more, make the price point more attractive for the consumers as of when the market scales. I feel that why should we keep talking about this? Can't the government see they have such a big commitment to the startups?
1655310378.0-1655333350.0
They can see, right, that this product is being made by startups. You have put 18% GST. There's a competing product which is like normal meat milk or whatever the product is which is coming from the animal sources that is at 5% or somewhere around that GST. So there's not a level playing field. So do you want our startups to fail?
1655336250.0-1655350266.0
It's not a rocket science. Government sees it, government knows it. So why should we tell everything through the government? Government also has the responsibility to the people of the country. Government also has the responsibility towards the startups.
1655350378.0-1655400222.0
Government also has the responsibility towards the youth. Government also has the responsibility towards the educated youth who have become entrepreneurs. And will they be able to survive if, for example, you get the normal milk at Rs60 a liter and you get swear milk at 160 or Rs140 a liter, how many people will be able to afford it? So when the soy milk industry has to work or old milk industry has to work to reduce the cost of the milk which is basically now called soya beverage and food beverage because we are not permitted to use the word heat. But on the other side, the GST is an aspect which is making it expensive, right?
1655400356.0-1655437030.0
So, because the other side, those are the established industries. So they have economies of scale and the cost of distribution is very low. So these are the startups. So they are relying on the strong consumer demand. So maybe we should all see that we should provide that level playing field so that they should not think that the big companies are able to market their sources of products lot more easily than the young boys and girls who have the startup.
1655443450.0-1655479830.0
Not only your own benefit for the benefit of the environment around you. And so much ethical conversation is going on around animal meat consumption and the coin. So this is like a benefit in broader perspective, the benefit of the society, not just like one can be more buying one product. So I simply say this, that these are all debatable topics, right? So while I will say that this is good for sustainability and this is good for the health of people, no protozoa, no harmful bacteria or viruses will travel through the animal sources of products into the human body.
1655479980.0-1655532690.0
As there was a scare, people have stopped eating meat during the corona times. But they were really scared that through the meat and through other animal products the unwanted bacteria will enter my body. And at the same time, on the sustainability issue, we know that a very large portion of the greenhouse gas emissions is coming from the agriculture. And from the agriculture, the largest sector comes from the dairy and meat industry. So that means that those greenhouse gases which are coming comet has already gone and said to the UN IPCC International Protocol for Climate Change that we will be in at zero by 2017.
1655532850.0-1655556894.0
So if we are going to have zero emissions, net zero emissions by 2017, that means we have to do something now. We cannot do abrupt changes. So what is that we are going to do now? We are doing EV so that electronic vehicles will reduce this thing and then we are going to phase out maybe coal over a period of time. So that's how some pollution will go down.
1655557012.0-1655592778.0
So similarly, in our industry, there is going to be more encouragement to the plant based food sector because that is where the emissions are less and young children, the way they are liking meat and chicken, the consumption of meat is skyrocketing in India and the way they like it. So tasty that if we were to have that kind of a situation ten from D is down the line. We will have to grow more water. So how much water we will grow? All we have is land in the country.
1655592944.0-1655603758.0
So we have to think. So the plant based food sector is coming. It is coming. Everything is starting with a zero. Right now we are standing at zero level zero.
1655603924.0-1655614960.0
We are not even $1 trillion, almost 600 $700 billion. So.
1655618290.0-1655643178.0
Not even $1 billion. We are one 10th of $1 billion. Suddenly we have move here just a small little dot in the big ocean. But this dot is becoming bigger very fast. In ten years time you will see it will become a $10 billion industry coming not only from outside the country but also from within the country.
1655643344.0-1655667700.0
There's so much of investment happening in this sector. Those people are understood that from my taste I can change the world. By controlling my taste I can change the world. Especially the excess also it aligns perfectly with the UN sustainability goals as well. Obviously everything is putting you towards opting for a cleaner diet at the moment.
1655668950.0-1655702000.0
We have a question from start dates right now. What is your take on Imagine meat startup by the day? Can I just add on to that and say that there have been a lot of celebrity association with the root startups as well. For example, Bluetieth Food has uncuscus online with our four years investors and this achievement has made it also has their own startup Imagine needs. So do you think that the start portions there is sort of also helping put the promotion for these plant based food and awareness as well?
1655702930.0-1655775286.0
Yeah, I know Imagine Me was about to come to this event and they had been in conversation with me and unfortunately we reached out to them at a very late stage and although they had to cancel their other programs to come here but logistically it was becoming difficult. So at a very last stage I regret that maybe next time they would prefer to be a part of it. And as far as Blue Tribe is concerned, they were very well represented and we are very happy that celebrities like Niracho PRA supporting Gutot or Dipika Path supporting Epigamia or you already mentioned Gluterite, they were all there in that room, you must have seen them. And we felt very happy that we have some known faces who are helping us to expand the market because these are not just faces themselves become plant based, they have themselves the eater of plant based foods. So they are vegetarian and they are the ones who are actually propagating it.
1655775388.0-1655835486.0
And there are so many celebrities, whether it is Vita Balan or it is Amita Chan or so many she was the one, Shekhar Kapoor, so many other celebrities who are already either vegan or vegetarian and they have been supporting the plant based cause in a very very big way and that's what makes the life easier. So I can clearly tell you there is a latent demand of billions of dollars. I don't want to put a number but we are not ready moment we are ready with the product which is yummy, which is healthy, which is safe, the market will grow like anything. So most of our products are falling in that category. Some of the products, they are still at the development stage.
1655835618.0-1655862398.0
They are still trying to figure out how to develop tuna, how to develop a particular kind of yoga. With the plant based sector. A very good company was present, white crab and they brought the dahi in that room. And that three was used for some of the telecases by the hotel. Porter had done a wonderful job.
1655862564.0-1655878338.0
I'm actually really surprised that help came from all the quarters. Minister gave a wonderful speech, better than anybody else gave. And he connected with his heart. So he's a natural benefit of her husband. And then a hotel.
1655878434.0-1655896442.0
He rose to the occasion. The hotel rose to the occasion. And they did not even look at the profit. I'm sure they must have lost money because they were putting so many of their own ingredients. And we had only given the main ingredient and we told them, now we make it.
1655896496.0-1655924370.0
Here is the recipe and here's my plant as meat. But what about ingredients, other ingredients which you need for cooking all that? What is gain surprise that golden did so much for us? There are about 25 to 30 or many more repetitions in that room. And all those were handled by the government, by the hotel hotel.
1655925510.0-1655942730.0
So their chef, lender and the senior chef, they were themselves connected. They said, we love this idea. You are working for the future generations. You are there. That means our children will have food tomorrow.
1655943230.0-1655959510.0
You are there. That means we will have a sustainable future. You are there. So that you are helping the Prime Minister to fulfill his promise of 2017, the net zero promise. So people are connecting and people are feeling.
1655959690.0-1655989290.0
They don't want to kill animals to eat so much of meat. They think that through their taste, they have to feel for the animals. There are different types of people who come forward and support. Some support because of health, some support because of the humanity and because of being humane and ethical. And some support because of sustainability and food security or nutrition.
1655993630.0-1656017870.0
Is in a very natural state right now. And it helps coming from everywhere like this. Where do you see the market going from another five years or ten years down the line? Example that in US we see plant based available in fast food outlets like McDonald's or Burma King. They started having a section of their own on plant based McDonald's.
1656017950.0-1656058160.0
I mean, in India it is still only available online platforms or their niches fasted or organic fast food. So availability is very less in India at the moment. So when you see the market going more than two times, none but dairy product.
1656061590.0-1656076760.0
So you consume dairy every day, right. So that answers your question. Why will people start eating Bashar only? They are more interested in this Daloti travel. Right?
1656078570.0-1656103422.0
It will take a long time for them to transition from Dal Roti travel to something else. Right? So we should not expect that people will change their dietary habits overnight. Only thing is, they would look for plant sources of the same diet. That is so while the plantbased burger will grow like this, but that.

Will still be a smaller market than the whole plant based foods which will come around us. If it is, let's say kebabs, they will try to make kebabs with the help of plan based foods. In any case, kebabs used to have some dal inside. So now you have dal plus other PLANBASED isolated proteins so that ice is already very active. And at the same time that the definition of plant based is also getting included with other food products where the protein consumption has come into a part of our conversation.
1656145070.0-1656165460.0
So that if we are consuming 40 grams protein, why can't we consume 70 grams protein? And that additional 30 grams protein should not come from meat, it should come from the plant based. False. So those are the things which I think will happen and I expect a lot.
1656168230.0-1656205630.0
One concern that comes to my mind when I think about the adoption of plant based soldiers, the market mostly right now is conscious our work eaters and millennials mostly things that food habits. Is it going to be difficult to get vegetarians to adopt this as an alternative source of protein? Because plant based meat still has a texture of mini and a lot of tastes of mine. So it's very difficult to get vegetables to adopt this. There was one of the companies which was in the room and that was Macau Foods.
1656206450.0-1656226200.0
So Macau Foods also went to Shark Tank and got funding from Jackfruit. That's right. So jackfroud is all natural. So it's not that plant based is only and only which is for the meat eating. Plant based is also for the non meat eating people.
1656226810.0-1656253930.0
So even they are doing wonderful recipes. And as I say, there are so many of our products which have got only very little component of animal sources. You put something cream in the end, so it becomes non plant based. So those will go away because people are looking for plant based foods. So that's how the whole market will start growing.
1656254090.0-1656291082.0
And the deeper conversations about changing the taste, I think is a difficult part. But the easier part would be where whatever is animal sources of foods will be easily get replaced. But eventually it will take care of the product environment and it will also take care of the newer recipes which will be developed so that Indian more tasty, vegetarian and plant based foods recipes. Not necessarily. They taste like wheat, right?

So if kabab were originated during mobile time, why can't originate kabab was so yummy that they stood the test of time. So why can't create one base and also yummy which may not taste like a bug, yet it is and yet it will increase the protein consumption, yet it will satiate the need for something tasty, so that itself will come up. So there will be many variations of plant based foods and plant based movements which will happen all at the same time. So in the coming period, we'll definitely see more and more it and food composition coming up in the plant based sector. Yes.
1656343456.0-1656381286.0
And that's why you must have seen how people were so interested to come to that room. I wouldn't say that everybody in that room was from the planbia sector because there were people who wanted to understand as to what is happening. So they were there because they smell money that something is likely to happen here and why don't we invest into that? Even if they have themselves meat eaters, they want to still start a plant based food. So the case in point is ITC ITC launched plant based food.
1656381388.0-1656383320.0
But they are also into the meat business.
1656387290.0-1656395900.0
Dominoes came with their buzzer where they removed the meat part with the plant based meat part.

Such tents are being made by various companies and I expect most food companies to be coming there. And that's why I also invited the managing director of Amod Rsoridi to come and speak. He was busy, so he couldn't make it because of the same day. There was some, I think irma board meeting and he's part of that. Something like that.
1656424664.0-1656460714.0
I don't remember exactly, but he was occupied of that day. Otherwise he was very keen to come as well. I saw somebody coming from Mother Terry into that room. So those companies, when they will do something, when Amal can have auto plant based products, which is plant based. So it's just a matter of time that all these animal sources companies will have something from the plant based also because those plants are also grown by the farmers.
1656460842.0-1656481510.0
It's not the only dairy farmer is a farmer, it's only meat farmer is a farmer, restaurant farmer is a farmer, food farmer is also a farmer and soya farmer is also a farmer. So among being the largest food company, I'm sure they will see the opportunity and they will also launch some canvas foods.
1656484250.0-1656493900.0
Adopting plant based alternatives and composition. That's something that can really drive adoption for plant based.
1656496750.0-1656512014.0
Because we all have been learnt. What happened to Kodak? When Kodak did not adopt a new medium, it almost disappeared. Right? So something given us this is a new medium.
1656512062.0-1656536760.0
It may take hundred years to dominate, but it is very fast from from zero to 1%. It will happen like this because at that stage the growth can be very, very fast. So imagine if we were we become 1% of $6 billion industry. That means we become $6 billion. That could be a non demand one.
1656538510.0-1656560234.0
Can you see how fast the growth is going to be in this industry? This industry is going to make a lot of noise. While the numbers may come up slowly, slowly in comparison to such a vast country that we are. But in terms of the absolute numbers, the growth will be very fast. What has the investor response been to this summer?
1656560282.0-1656583110.0
And the companies that they met there. They are very happy. Investors are very happy because they know that there's something for them to make money on. So they're very happy about that and they want to investors will go where the money is. It's very simple.
1656583260.0-1656623202.0
So we never should bother about finding out what is that investor is looking at. Investor will automatically invest if he thinks that the customer wants it. And we you and we know customer wants it. A proof of that was on that day, the kind of promotion which happened, people not letting even the conference to move because there were testing going on and we had hard time controlling the people. So that was actually proof that Taste, they were changing my conference on that day, taste, because they loved those yummy plant based foods and conferences was getting disturbed because it was in the same room.
1656623336.0-1656655886.0
We had to request them be folded and kindly give us half an hour more and then you can take all these recipes. We are almost at the end of our time when I have one last question. How is this planted food Summit going to look like? If you have imagined things for that yet planning to do something, how much? My question was how is the second plant based food Summit is going to look next year?
1656655988.0-1656674200.0
I mean, the first one had phenomenal response and we saw how it the snowball into something so big. How how is the second one going to look like? What are your plans for this? So in this plant based Food Summit, it was 100 scientists and 100 entrepreneurs. We focused on that.
1656674650.0-1656699326.0
But the second Summit, I think will be focused on Fssci food safety and spenders authority of India. We are going to work very closely with it, right? And FSSAI and ask them that how we make sure that our startups they cross the bar. I am very much buried myself. So we feel that we have to help them.
1656699508.0-1656736220.0
They need help. Otherwise these young boys and girls, they will simply fall by the wayside and we took too cruel to kill their dream. So I think that from now onwards, we are going to focus only on one thing how to develop the product properly, which is wholesale, which is not overprocessed, which is healthy, which is safe, which is yummy, which is lower price, even price. I'm not so much bothered at this stage. I'm only focused on the good quality and tasty and healthy products.
1656737790.0-1656775042.0
So if that happens, for that, the second summit has to be to prepare and celebrate some of that. Our second Summit will be some celebration because I'm expecting some good deals to happen this year and we will bring them on stage, those who have got the money from the investors this year. So we will celebrate their success. And the celebration will be in such a way that we would make it a little bit more inclusive this time. I feel sad and my apologies to those whose registration was not accepted.
1656775186.0-1656805680.0
But next year we will not do that. We will bring in more people and format will not change. Format will still be the same, but we will work more in depth on those report which came out. The report was already getting a lot of traction and people are asking on the social media and other places to have a copy of that and we are going to launch it. Maybe we can have a separate conversation at Kulkay only on the report.
1656807650.0-1656859354.0
We can talk about the Danaflan basis and we'll make sure that 600 people at least have on Kulkay on that day and they listen to that conversation about the report, because report has some interesting things which have come out and this is all about the opportunity for India. And we'll make sure that we'll send a copy of this report to all the chief ministers in the country. We'll make sure that we send a copy of this to all the International Plant Based Food Working Group members all over the world. A physical copy. As you know, I'm one of the founding directors of the International Plant Based Food Working Group and that organization is having seven founding directors.

So India is represented by me. So India is one, europe has got two. One is from UK, another is US, which is PBFA, which Rachel had come over and the chairperson of the board, Nicole Sopco, had come over during the summit. And there's also China and there's also Canada. Leslie from Canada.
1656881554.0-1656929430.0
So there are seven people who meet together every month, virtually this time. At least two of us, we could meet physically. Also, we had a meeting on 23rd. So we are now going to engage with all the stakeholders and share not only the report, but also put into build the report for the next year, so that next year report would have lot more deeper things about this sector. Well, I'm definitely looking forward to the report and I am hoping on the report in media as well, because as far as I know, there's a new vegan community in India and they're excited to see new news about products and companies and conversations around legal food right now.
1656929580.0-1656970654.0
Yeah, I don't think our team members were also very happy delivering this report. We had done it with a foreign author, with the help of PBFA, and also we had a team of volunteers which was led by a PSG scholar, Nisharai, and she did a wonderful job, the whole team did a wonderful job. So she had curated so much of information from all over the nature and all over the experts, all over India. So all the India part was done by her. And I'm very happy that young professionals are burning the midnight oil.
1656970702.0-1656990838.0
And actually they came up with a wonderful report I recommend to you and you should not only read it, you should tell your viewers to read it. Definitely. And we are almost at the end of our time today. Thank you so much for taking the time to come on our platform. I hope you enjoyed our conversation because I love it.
1656990924.0-1656997670.0

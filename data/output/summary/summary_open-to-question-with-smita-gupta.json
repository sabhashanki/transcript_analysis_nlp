Her speech there was heartbreaking and has been described as a foundation stone for much of the cooperation, disagreement and politics that would develop I think what she was trying to convey, Smitha, was the fact that in India, india was still a poor country. Problems associated with poverty, land degradation, lack of access to water, these are all what we don't normally consider to Smita: We have to balance, we have to walk on both legs. Pollution is having a morbidity impact. It's having a mortality impact. People are falling ill because of environment.
